	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Interesting to note along this trajectory of development is that philosophy of mind in general, and also the cognitive science aspect of it, has been dominated by philosophers working in the analytic tradition, the exception being the growing contribution of scholars working from a phenomenological perspective.2‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4W5P4VP?page=3&annotation=UL2DSPSQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Important to note for this article is that Dreyfus‚Äô emphasis, following Heidegger, on the everyday ‚Äúready-to-handness‚Äù of the world for human intelligence as opposed to a kind of objectively-outthere represented world, as well as the enactivist approach pioneered by Varela and taken forward by, among others Gallagher, has been taken up lately in the work of the cognitive scientist, Randall Beer, who is also one of the main proponents of the so-called situated, embodied, dynamic (SED) AI architecture (Beer 2014). Apart from Dreyfus, Beer specifically mentions Winograd and Flores (1986), Varela, Rosch and Thompson (1991), Clark (1997) and Wheeler (2005) as authors that try to bring the insights of phenomenology to bear on cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4W5P4VP?page=3&annotation=AEFN2WGP) 
	 	- Discuss with Gabija 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Following Heidegger, Deleuze points out that since at least the pre-Socratic Parmenides Western philosophy has favoured unity, stability and sameness over diversity, change and difference. The result of this philosophical choice was, Deleuze avers, a ‚Äúdogmatic image of thought‚Äù (1994, 131) according to which difference has for the most part been conceived in negative terms as what is not the same, not unified, not universal. In the dogmatic image of thought, difference has in other words always been made subject to identity.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4W5P4VP?page=4&annotation=WJHPF4KX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"The upshot in Deleuze‚Äôs thought of difference is a world made up of singularities. In fact, although Deleuze speaks of an evanescent materiality that is at its most raw and perhaps not even distinguished into discrete singularities, the very next step in his thinking about this materiality involves speaking of pre-individual singularities or intensities within the evanescent materiality, with the result that for all practical intents and purposes Deleuze‚Äôs world starts with a manifold of disparate singularities (Deleuze 1994; Hughes 2009).‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4W5P4VP?page=4&annotation=4DWNWEV3) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"As indicated above, singularities may be described as intensities in the evanescent material world. In the context of a discussion of cadence and rhythm, Deleuze (1994, 21) gives the following characterisation of intensity:  [I]ntensive values act by creating inequalities or incommensurabilities between metrically equivalent periods or spaces. They create distinctive points, privileged instants which always indicate a poly-rhythm. Here again, the unequal is the most positive element.  The point is that the material flux is not homogenous, but is made up of intensities that constitute spatial and temporal inequalities. Repetition can now be considered as the events in which material  4 Material sensibility should not be confused with sense as meaning. The latter is addressed in Deleuze‚Äôs other major work of the late 1960s, Logic of Sense (Deleuze 1990). Where the word sense is used in this essay, it should be understood to refer to material sensibility. inequalities (singularities) continue to exist in difference, or where they are grasped together in the emergence of sensibility, which is another way of existing in difference.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U4W5P4VP?page=4&annotation=88CTSKTM)
