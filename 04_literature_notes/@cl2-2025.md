	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:  • EU and national decision makers, researchers, practitioners and media organisations are equipped to deliver effective prevention and counter measures on radicalisation, extremism, hate speech and polarisation, based on a better understanding of the drivers and mechanisms of extremism, hate speech and polarisation, and by implementing effective recommendations, tools, narratives, methodologies, and other solutions.  • Improved evidence-based policymaking to counter and prevent radicalisation, extremism, hate speech and polarisation, based on experiments that apply the results of  previous research and innovation projects in a practical/educational real-life context, allowing the replication of methods and recommendations for legislative changes or for the translation of research findings into innovations.  • EU institutions and national policymakers gain insights into radicalisation, extremism, and hate speech, including their impact on young people and how youth perceive and engage with information on these phenomena, whether online or offline.  • EU institutions, national decision-makers, and civil society organisations acquire a thorough understanding of the mechanisms driving successful extremist, radical, and  hate campaigns, as well as the diverse political environments and their modes of interaction and communication, extending beyond social media and online platforms”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R2R9SUIT?page=34&annotation=D8U4EUPB)
