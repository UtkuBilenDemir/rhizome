- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Internet has transformed practically every aspect of contemporary life, especially the way we think about the body and its relation to identity and to place, once the twin cornerstones of social existence”</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=153&annotation=7SN4NRLL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adults-children, and so on. We are segmented in a circular fashion, in ever larger circles, ever wider disks or coronas, like Joyce&#39;s &#39;letter&#39;: my affairs, my neighbourhood&#39;s affairs, my city&#39;s, my country&#39;s, the world&#39;s … We are segmented in a linear fashion, along a straight line or a number of straight lines, of which each segment represents an episode or &#39;proceeding&#39;: as soon as we finish one proceeding we begin another, forever proceduring or procedured, in the family, in the school, in the army, on the job. (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 208-9)”</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=153&annotation=ZGK4L7ND) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"They describe these socially orchestrated captures of the body - gender, race, class, work, family, and so on - as &#39;incorporeal transformations&#39;.”</mark> [Page 153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=153&annotation=CYEDJTFV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"The soul is the body without organs seen in its disciplined aspect, but it is not the whole of the body without organs. Foucault&#39;s vision of the duplication of the body is an impoverished one in comparison to Deleuze and Guattari&#39;s, and he pays the price for this conceptual diminishment Deleuze and the Internet 1 45  by leaving himself with no plausible means of explaining how or why one might adhere to the conventions and demands of the socius itself except through coercion.”</mark> [Page 154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=154&annotation=NI26LM2M) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"The full body without organs is the soul ani mated by desire.”</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=155&annotation=CG3FSP8U) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"we all have our own body without organs, but it is plugged into a larger entity that is the body without organs of all bodies without organs, or the plane of con sistency.”</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=155&annotation=IPYS8SXW) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the constellation of partial objects constituting our desire in its transitive mode.”</mark> [Page 155](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=155&annotation=AAYZMTQ8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"hat she effectively claims, without using this terminology, is that gender is an incorporeal transformation: the very labels &#39;man&#39; or &#39;woman&#39; seize and transform us. Gender is an attribute an effect - that penetrates our bodies and functions there as &#39;quasi cause&#39; Deleuze and the I nternet 1 47  of everything we do. We are not born into our gender, we assume it, but once it has taken hold we act in its name. This effect interacts with other effects, such as race and class. As Butler points out, even if one accepted that it was possible to choose one&#39;s gender, it is nevertheless impossible to choose not to have any gender at all.”</mark> [Page 156](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=156&annotation=YW8QTAF7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"But, as she effectively wants to argue, but doesn&#39;t quite have the vocabulary to do so, they are very far from naturally occurring - they are engendered but in such a way that they seem to fall back on themselves and smother their origins from view so as to appear unengendered. This is how the body without organs operates. Its chief operation is to &#39;fall back on&#39; itself and create a smooth plane for desire. This example points to what is perhaps the key feature of the body without organs: it functions as pure presupposition, that is, the thought or idea which thought cannot grasp. It is like our soul, always there, always in need of work, and always unreachable.”</mark> [Page 157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=157&annotation=VHH4XTQX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The body without organs is not a &#39;feedback loop&#39;, as Bard and Soderqvist suggest, because what occurs on the body without organs is not the same thing, and isn&#39;t constructed in the same way, as the body without organs itself (Bard and Soderqvist 2002: 1 1 3 ) . What occurs on the body without organs doesn&#39;t feed back into it. To continue the example above - if I cross-dress I may be playing with (my) gender, but I&#39;m not thereby altering it, whether on an experiential level or a theo retical level. By the same token, because the body without organs is a virtual entity, Katherine Hayles&#39; complaint that it doesn&#39;t pay enough heed to physical constraints is without foundation (Hayles 2001 : 1 54). More to the point, conceptually the body without organs should be understood as our way of coping with physical constraints. It is our means of fabricating a mental position from which to view the condi tions of our everyday life as making sense.”</mark> [Page 157](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=157&annotation=5TMAPGI2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Internet equals freedom.2 This is the Internet&#39;s body without organs: the great and unquestioned presupposition that it is an agent of freedom. The &#39;material problem confronting schizoanalysis is knowing whether&#39; the bodies without organs we have are any good or not, or more to the Deleuze and the I nternet 1 49  point, knowing whether we have the means of determining whether they are any good or not (Deleuze and Guattari 1 9 8 7: 1 6 5 ) .”</mark> [Page 158](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UZNQKTX6?page=158&annotation=K7MFGC8L)
