> abstract:: In 1990, Gilles Deleuze published
              Postscript on the Societies of Control
              , an introduction to the potentially suffocating reality of the nascent control society. This thirty-year update details how Deleuze’s conception has developed from a broad speculative vision into specific economic mechanisms clustering around personal information, big data, predictive analytics, and marketing. The central claim is that today’s advancing control society coerces without prohibitions, and through incentives that are not grim but enjoyable, even euphoric because they compel individuals to obey their own personal information. The article concludes by delineating two strategies for living that are as unexplored as control society itself because they are revealed and then enabled by the particular method of oppression that is control.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In 1990, Gilles Deleuze published Postscript on the Societies of Control, an introduction to the potentially suffocating reality of the nascent control society.”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=&annotation=WM82236K) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"How can there be control if nothing is forbidden?”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=2&annotation=SSMZLPWD) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The answer is predictive analytics: data-driven marketing and social media strategies that regulate through incentives. Consumers are not contained, blocked, or forced, but they are lured and directed by marketing appeals exploiting personal information. The third aim of this essay is practical: it is to explore how technology users can respond to the control society.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=2&annotation=M6CLFCR9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"But, the weakness is offset when movements are remotely tracked”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=3&annotation=FFWKVLEH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Deleuze discipline versus control does not create a hierarchy so much as distinct contexts for a continuing tension between social oppression and personal freedom (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=3&annotation=2QUNCERM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Deleuze’s vision of social organisation without walls and constraints has developed rapidly.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=4&annotation=H6GCIZN5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Turning from technology to mood, there was an anguish in the original essay. It is up to us, Deleuze warned, ‘to discover what we’re being made to serve’ when our lives are subjected to the control society (Deleuze 1992: 7).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=5&annotation=X5LFLJ4T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"There is no centralised power to plot against, and control societies are not fearsome and inscrutable. ‘Entertaining,’ is more accurate. Of course, there is a threat inherent in the mass trivialisation of existence. The addictions of the algorithms dehumanise in their own ways, just as do the sweatshops of industrialisation.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=6&annotation=FB972HKY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Because today’s watchers want profit, not personal intimacy, they are interested in profiles, not specific people, and their attention is drawn to opportunities, not embarrassing information. If they are interested in vulnerability at all, then they mean vulnerable to appeals, like the new mother’s enveloping concern for the health of her newborn, or the teenage boy’s fixation on the size of his biceps. What comes next is not psychological persecution; instead, it is online coupons discounting a baby car seat, it is a protein drink free sample (Završnik and Levičnik 2015).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=7&annotation=P3BYKB3U) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"If submission to the data inspecting of digital platforms yields rewards, it is even possible to imagine an aspiration or devotion to control. Why not actively reveal your browsing history, location data, and credit card purchases if that means your interests will be discerned and wishes efficiently met with packaged goods? Why not present your desires and fears for conversion into numerical maps for algorithmic processing in exchange for entertaining video suggestions from Netflix, attractive job opportunities from LinkedIn?”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=8&annotation=2ACK2D2P) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"None of these temptations imply that control has become less manipulative, only that control now is distinct psychologically from its origin: what started as obsession and dread has transformed into manic gratification.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=8&annotation=L2RZ9P24) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Let us switch the update from psychology to strategy. Deleuze began envisioning control as movements tracked, and occasionally blocked by the maddeningly irregular locking of doors and passageways. However, in an immaculate control environment there are no impediments, not a single vestige of disciplinary enclosure. Pure control is limitless, obstacle-free. The ideal translates into a requirement to manage society’s elements without blockages and prohibitions: a plan for getting out in front and directing. Perfected control does not only follow along, chart locations, and decipher patterns, it also leads.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=8&annotation=NPUET95K) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In a disciplinary society, we are always starting over again. Life is a constant reset as we convert from the bedroom, to the kitchen, to the workspace. Appropriate shoes are donned for work, later jeans because it is leisure time, then pyjamas for sleep. In control, things never begin or end, we are always in the middle. Deleuze remembers the ambiguous start and constant postponements of Kafka’s Trial, and mentions the interminability of continuing education.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=11&annotation=S6CAIC4T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Work emails get read in bed at 3 am. Leisure Friday became leisure everyday years ago, which does not only imply that work is becoming more comfortable, but also that the difference between work and leisure is becoming less definable.”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=12&annotation=ZA335TYB) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The danger of control, by contrast, emanates from the subhuman. What threatens our ability to assemble a personal sense of who we are is the isolable parts of ourselves.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=13&annotation=2CV6F575) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"It also enables Deleuze’s joy of marketing, which is selling from abundance: you want to go on the next trip not because the last one was less than satisfying, but because it was so enjoyable.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2JPY9QBL?page=14&annotation=KGM7XTPI)
