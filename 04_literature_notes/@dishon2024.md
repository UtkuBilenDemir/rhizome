            The emergence of ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools (GenAI) capable of producing human-like texts sparked debates concerning whether we are at the dawn of a new age of writing and meaning-making. Rather than weighing in on the potential impact of GenAI, this paper engages with the implicit sociotechnical imaginaries underpinning reactions to GenAI. One particularly evocative source for sociotechnical imaginaries are fictional texts, which can shape our shared imagination of possible and probable futures. Accordingly, I analyze two seminal works of fiction: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (Planet eBooks, 1818) and Franz Kafka’s The Trial (Echo Library, 1925). Frankenstein is regarded as an enduring myth that has shaped perceptions of artificial life. This paper sets out to explore the limitations of the ‘Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary’ by unpacking AI’s assumed modes of meaning-making along three axes: (1) agency, (2) relations, and (3) control. Within the Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary, AI is approached in anthropomorphic terms, emphasizing the struggle over control of meaning-making without reshaping its overarching logic. The Trial, in contrast, offers a lens that challenges common dichotomies underpinning the Frankenstein model: (1) highlighting the entanglement between AI and human intentionality in processes of meaning-making, (2) exploring human-AI relations as recursively shaped through the complementary tendency of humans and GenAI to generate and infer meaning, and (3) shifting the notion of control from a struggle over domination to an emphasis on how GenAI concurrently expands the available choices while limiting humans’ influence over patterns of meaning-making.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The Trial shifts our orientation from the Frankensteinian depiction of AI as an external actor with which humans struggle, to a focus on an endless process of humans and GenAI striving to ‘decipher’ each other, further blurring the entanglement of machines in evolving human practices of seeking and making meaning.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=3&annotation=QXPX9FM7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Here, it is vital to distinguish two stages in GenAI model development: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, GenAI learns from vast datasets to identify patterns and generate similar content. This stage is marked by its unstructured approach and unpredictability. In fine-tuning, the model’s capabilities are tailored by applying targeted reinforcement learning (usually via human feedback) to refine and direct its behaviors towards more specific contexts and outcomes (Ouyang et al. 2022; Sharma et al. 2023).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=3&annotation=SV85XE38) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Further, sociotechnical imaginaries go beyond an analysis of language or discourse to include how visions of social life are materialized and performed through technology (Jasanoff and Kim 2015). Attention to diverse and contested imaginaries is pivotal in the case of novel technologies, such as GenAI, that are still in the stage of interpretive flexibility, in which various depictions struggle (explicitly or implicitly) for establishing the dominant framing of a given technology (Ramiel and Dishon 2023; Natale and Ballatore 2020; Richter et al. 2023).”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=4&annotation=7TWV4PFD) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Thus, artificial life is portrayed as a discrete entity, largely mirroring human agency.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=5&annotation=HTT9MDIV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Though AI is depicted as possessing superior capabilities—both physically and mentally (the creature quickly learns to talk and read)—the overall logic governing pattens of meaning-making remains stable.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=5&annotation=Y6JXWTC4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous. (114)”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=6&annotation=DDU5NAWD) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Thus, these sociotechnical imaginaries postulate a world similar to our own, yet one in which humanity loses its status at the top of the (no longer organic) food chain.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=7&annotation=F8V7KJ8W) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"heart of worries concerning AI developing human desires and behaviors, from love to domination. Critically, these worries are based the Frankensteinian logic—GenAI does not introduce here new modes of thinking or meaning-making, it is a threat to humanity exactly because of its all-too-human nature.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=7&annotation=2JQTQJ4X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Not only does this bizarre state of affairs—of K. not knowing what he is accused of—persist throughout the novel; the question of the actual crime becomes secondary to K.’s efforts to navigate the intricate bureaucracy of the court in which he is being accused (Solove 2001).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=8&annotation=Y7KTZWBG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"He still felt unable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called Lanz… so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms. (43)”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=8&annotation=3IBR3NN5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"‘the court does not want anything from you. It accepts you when you come and it lets you go when you leave.’ (264)”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=8&annotation=NJVFGXD5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In contrast to the human-like and anthropomorphic agency of Frankenstein, The Trial offers a distinctively different model. The court does not work according to a well-defined legal system or by reference to truth. Instead, it is guided by its relations with the subjectivities of the accused (Benjamin 1969; Munro and Huber 2012). Though the court is positioned as The source of meaning-making, it does not include an identifiable author or decipherable forms of agency. In fact, through the constant echoing and distortion of K.’s own agency, the court dissipates the very notion of a discrete and identifiable agency.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=9&annotation=CHS8DI7T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted like I was asking was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. (212)”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=9&annotation=DCW38LW7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Thus, paradoxically, the best way to arrive at a definite outcome is to make sure the process never ends. Interactions with the court are necessary and require constant maintenance, yet they cannot be controlled, predicted, or even expected to progress towards a resolution. The novel could be viewed as turning the meaning of a trial upside down—it is not meant to arrive at a verdict or outcome, rather it is the process itself on which one must center.”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=10&annotation=W2ARW9TH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The Trial offers a depiction of control that relies on a different understanding of meaning-making—shifting from a stable and general model of meaning to an idiosyncratic and personalized one.”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=10&annotation=U5HF3NE8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The duality of the law being both personally tailored and inaccessible is emblematic of the dynamics of meaning-making in the novel.”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=10&annotation=QJK9V9RJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"the reader is constantly lured to formulate a stable and comprehensive understanding of the text, but in line with the parable, the semblance of meaning only signifies its inaccessibility”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=11&annotation=DXPA5SEF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The Trial offers a lens that invites us to reframe processes of meaning-making altogether.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=11&annotation=P35DQRJ8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Within this Kafkaesque sociotechnical imaginary, GenAI is not treated as an external agent. Instead, it serves to further blur the distinctions between external and internal facets of agency, making it harder to gauge the demarcation between human and machine intentionality.”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=12&annotation=YJRQEK42) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Finally, researchers have identified recursive processes that illustrate how humans and GenAI are reciprocally entangled. For instance, during fine-tuning, GenAI models are likely to offer answers that are better aligned with user preferences, even if they are less truthful (Sharma et al. 2023). At the same time, humans are likely to modify meaning-making processes in order to maximize GenAI’s capabilities (Mishra and Heath 2024).”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=12&annotation=FXY5BCLP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"k of a definite answer does not deter K., or the reader, from searching for meaning. This perpetual process of searching for and constructing meaning is a productive lens through which to conceptualize human relations with GenAI. In contrast to the agonistic relations of two distinct subjects in Frankenstein, The Trial depicts relations that are based on an endless process of humans striving to decipher and shape GenAI’s agency.”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=12&annotation=VA676WG7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The Trial is not about humans losing control over their creations, if they ever had control in the first place. Instead, it foreshadows GenAI’s capacity to generate content that is personalized to every actor (and thus shaped by humans) yet is not amenable to control through explicit choices. This model of meaningmaking undermines the dichotomy between choice and coercion, no longer positioning the two as mutually exclusive.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=13&annotation=ETWWQETX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"based on choices whose details are fundamentally determined by GenAI, and which often include personalization according to what GenAI calculates as users’ individual intentions or preferences (Natale and Depounti 2024).”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=13&annotation=YANRXWTG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In this respect, while GenAI offers more choices and personalization, it is not clear when and how this supports or impedes human choice. For instance, in contrast to previous writing technologies, which mainly edited human texts, with GenAI humans become the editors of machine-written texts, whose rationale remains blackboxed (Robinson 2023).”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=13&annotation=LT8ZC925) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Therefore, as in Before the Law, personalization does not inherently entail increased control over meaning-making, but rather its increased mediation according to what GenAI identifies, or perhaps determines, as our personal preferences.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JM7IVNNK?page=13&annotation=2V94Y4J7)
