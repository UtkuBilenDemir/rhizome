              This short piece discusses Hélène Landemore’s proposal of an ‘open democracy’, as outlined in her recent book
              Open Democracy: Reinventing Popular Rule for the Twenty-First Century
              . Acknowledging the value of Landemore’s radical and ambitious proposals, I draw attention to a number of shortcomings and blind spots that have to do with how the case for an ‘open democracy’ is made: through an unduly brief and dismissive treatment of political parties; a methodological insensitivity to empirical variations of democratic performance and citizens’ evaluations of the latter; a failure to distinguish between higher and ordinary law-making in the discussion of the central Icelandic case; and, finally, a surprising concession that realising an open democracy is all but infeasible in established constitutional democracies. If open democracy is to be an attractive ideal, these issues must arguably be addressed.

- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The problem, in other words, is that we have institutionalised the wrong ideal of democracy. What makes it wrong is that it: a) introduces, via elections, ‘systematic discriminatory effects in terms of who has access to power, specifically agenda-setting power’ (Landemore 2020, p. 26); and it b) brings with it ‘a type of party politics that is itself not all that conducive to deliberation or its prerequisite virtues, such as open-mindedness’ (Landemore 2020, p. 26).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=2&annotation=T665L8KD) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"For one thing, parties construct and signify the primary conflict lines in society, the main political alternatives that citizens can choose between.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=3&annotation=ZTK9PI58) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"mobilisation function of parties that requires the creation of partisan identities and mindsets is actually quite essential to get people to care about politics in the first place, for it ‘links the distant and formidable, often inscrutable institutions of the state with the passions, interests, prepossessions, and beliefs of ordinary citizens’”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=3&annotation=BLIGNVLN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"necessarily harmful to deliberation”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=3&annotation=Y5J44AAP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"well real-world representative democracies function—and, correspondingly, differences in how satisfied citizens are with ‘their’ democracies? It is uncontroversial that some representative democracies (think, e.g., of some of the Nordic countries) function better in terms of equal representation, policy outputs, etc. than others (e.g., the US). But if the problem is the very ideal of representative democracy—if, that is, this conception of democracy is indeed not ‘fit for purpose’ in the twenty-first century—should not democracies be failing universally?”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=5&annotation=IFPKHD37) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"But this response calls for an explanation as to (i) what exactly is dysfunctional about those representative democracies that seem to work comparatively well (e.g., according to leading democracy indices such as V-Dem), and, even more challengingly, (ii) what those citizens who are relatively satisfied with their democracies (to cite just some examples, 72% of Swedish citizens and 68% of Dutch citizens are satisfied with democracy, see Pew Research Center 2020, p. 23) misperceive or fail to understand about the political system they live under. It is difficult to see how this could be done in a convincing fashion.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=5&annotation=MUIDUUGY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Second, Landemore would also have to argue that any citizen who is satisfied with how her national democratic system performs is simply wrong about her national democratic system.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=5&annotation=S3VA3FTP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Setting to one side the question of whether or not this might be a rather undemocratic argument to make, it clearly jars with Landemore’s epistemic credo of ‘diversity trumps ability’ (see Landemore 2012), in that it implies that, when it comes to the evaluation of democratic institutions, the theorist’s verdict concerning the correct democratic ideal(s) trumps the verdict of (potentially very many) citizens. This strikes me as self-defeating.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YQ3PM8Z2?page=5&annotation=5IXFJNXB)
