- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"This manifested itself in Foucault’s notion of “disciplinary societies,” where individuals are shaped and constrained by mechanisms of surveillance and control (Discipline and Punish, p.170–194). In these societies, the subject is molded by external forces that maintain order and categorize identity. Over time, however, this model evolved into what philosopher Gilles Deleuze (Postscript on the Societies of Control, 1992) describes as “societies of access and control,” where mechanisms of power become more fluid and decentralized, enabling a more pervasive, albeit less visible, form of governance. Selfhood here is no longer merely an object of discipline but becomes embedded in networks of access, data, and surveillance, shaping the subject within a landscape of control that is simultaneously liberating and constraining—coalescing both the virtual and material. It follows, then, that the dimensionality of selfhood continues to rhizomatically fracture between control, surveillance, codes of exclusion and other forms of domination, aptly moving beyond the dialectic, capturing the emergent socio-political arrangements that define our experience as posthuman subjects.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/U5HZIU74?page=3&annotation=88B2CDZI)

	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In this configuration, the evolution of thought and identity becomes deeply intertwined with a Spinozist “monist” conception of the material world, wherein all existence is seen as part of a single, unified substance.
