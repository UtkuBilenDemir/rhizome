- <mark class="hltr-gray">"A MID the Make Poverty History campaign in 2004, the U2 singer and political activist Bono said, ‘I represent a lot of people [in Africa] who have no voice at all...They haven’t asked me to represent them. It’s cheeky but I hope they’re glad I do’.1”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=1&annotation=NABBQGX3) 
	 	- Such a good example

I have to say 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"surrogate representation”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=2&annotation=XW84VC8T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Surrogates, in her terms, are not elected by the people they are acting as surrogates for, but they are elected by some other constituency. In my view, the notion of surrogacy can usefully be extended to include actors who are not elected at all.4”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=2&annotation=7MVLT7QU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The nature of and theoretical grounds for this basic shift in focus I have outlined elsewhere.8 But in brief: none of us is ever fully represented—representation of our interests or identities in politics is always incomplete and partial. This implies that representation is about a claim (redeemed, if at all, only partially), and not a fact or a possession. We might elect a politician or a party into office, but the simple fact of their election, important though that is, does not mean they can or will speak for the range of interests and identities that make us up.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=3&annotation=26TNTWS8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"a Subject stands for an Object—an elected MP for a constituency, for example. But we need to look more widely than this. Someone makes the claim—a Maker. And the thing represented is an idea of it, not the thing itself; the latter is better called a Referent (if a politician Makes himself the Subject who stands for an Object, the Object is his idea of his constituency—‘decent, hard-working folk’ for example—rather than the Referent, which is all the other things the constituency is, or might be). All of this needs, and has, an Audience, which receives the claims and accepts, rejects or ignores them.10”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=3&annotation=636KN9W8) 
	 	- Once again the MSORA system 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Elective representation does not exhaust democratic representation.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=4&annotation=NA3SPUGX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"But bear in mind that while temporary governments are chosen, they are part of the permanent state, which is not chosen (or at least can’t be, now). From that angle, it is our fate, and not our choice, to have government in the form that we do”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=4&annotation=JLVURYFF) 
	 	- Choice & Consent 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Related to this, elected politicians have a ‘captive constituency’: almost all citizens are formally structured into electoral districts. This lessens the amount of work that elected politicians have to do to make convincing claims, since the structure of the context decrees already that there must be specific, definable constituency interests which require formal representation.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=5&annotation=KKQDRV3V) 
	 	- Identification 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"At a strongly abstract level representation, in its most familiar contemporary guises, is One to All—one state, to all citizens in the country. The symbolic architecture of our political systems reflects and reinforces this metaphor: the gathering of all under one, the legislature that brings the nation together symbolically under one roof.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=5&annotation=P79JTATA) 
	 	- Oneness and unity 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Less abstractly, in most contemporary democratic systems, parties choose candidates prior to voter choices. Key choices are therefore made before citizens get to vote”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=6&annotation=R7MPEA7U) 
	 	- Control and accountability 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Political leaders regularly portray themselves as standing for the nation, above and beyond narrow and partial interests (think of the ubiquity of the Stars and Stripes in set-piece images of US presidents and candidates). The architecture of their contexts also contributes to this need, and habit. All of this is part of representation seen through the lens of the representative claim.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=7&annotation=G7DIHMBF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"A variety of non-elected actors claim to be representatives, and sometimes those claims have a resonance with their audiences because they can sometimes do things that elective claimants cannot do (or cannot do so readily).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=4Y8IFGR4) 
	 	- About the significance of the non-elected actors 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"For example, a range of unelected representative claimants:”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=5IT8U3CT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"don’t have to pretend to represent the whole person’s interests or wants; they can explicitly be partial (so can elected actors, but they often have less scope to do so);”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=HWWMT4LG) 
	 	- partiality 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"can stand for a continuous, evolving sense of us, free from the temptations of the election-time snapshot;”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=YE2V2QLQ) 
	 	- free from election time fluctations 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"can be temporary representatives as circumstances demand in a fast-changing political world (‘oneness’, as discussed above, is about a (representation of) permanence, implying a permanent structure of interests, identities and wills);”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=7685GF8V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"are not spatially challenged by the borders of nations, but can claim to speak for interests (or would-be constituencies) that span different countries with a greater freedom than elected actors can;”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=6528VZSG) 
	 	- free from affiliation, got the opportunity to speak for communities tho 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"have to make their claims explicit—have to work harder to make their representative claims convincing, because the symbolic architecture of our political systems doesn’t do that work for them. They have to invoke and enthuse (and even build from scratch) an audience for their claims;17”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=B8S4NKB5) 
	 	- More careful and precise claim construction. 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"can open up new patterns of representation that are alternative to elective patterns.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=8&annotation=38VFJTIL) 
	 	- New cleavages new veto points 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The claims are grouped as follows: 1. ‘deeper roots’ representative claims; 2. ‘expertise and special credentials’ claims; and 3. ‘wider interests and new voices’ claims.”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=10&annotation=TIDZFEK6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"One might read John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice, for example, as offering a basis upon which a political figure could claim that our deeper, more rational selves would all sign up to a certain, specifiable distribution of ‘primary goods’ such as rights and duties.20”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=11&annotation=DAUNFUT4) 
	 	- Deeöer roots 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"A claim may be based on the possession of authoritative knowledge arising from specialist expertise. Here, a person may claim to represent a group because he or she possesses specialist expertise (in, say, environmental science) which fosters a distinctive insight into potentially neglected or underplayed interests of the group.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=11&annotation=I95GJ9H8) 
	 	- specialist expertise 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Such figures may not only claim to represent non-national interests on the basis of common humanity, but potentially also to represent the better interests of those in their ‘home’ countries (or ‘the West’) whose actions are linked to the plight of many in the ‘South’ in ways that are not immediately obvious to the people concerned.”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=12&annotation=ZR3NNJZX) 
	 	- surrogacy and wider interests 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"she represents those opposed to the Iraq war because she was a popular key speaker at a huge rally on the issue”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=12&annotation=6WXTZIZZ) 
	 	- The word from the street 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In a quite different sense, a ‘mirroring’ representative claim may arise along the lines of the case of Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatista army in Chiapas, Mexico. Marcos argues that his army does not ‘speak for’ the people of Chiapas. Rather, it ‘listens’, or ‘echoes’, the voices of the people.30”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=13&annotation=JMB4YRU8) 
	 	- Mirroring (zapatista) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Claims to represent or speak for human communities-of-fate which cross national boundaries may be another example.31 These examples, to be sure, involve a radical deconstruction of our received ideas of what a ‘constituency’ is, and can very quickly probe the limitations of our conventional vocabularies of representation and enfranchisement.3”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=14&annotation=VJ5S7WVX) 
	 	- stakeholder 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"UN mandate and its representative organisations in Kosovo in recent years, or the representative claims being made on behalf of the people of Darfur by UN and other actors in 2006 and 2007.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=14&annotation=BEVS7CWD) 
	 	- Extraterritorial rules and laws 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"being heard or represented’ and attempt to make good the perceived shortfall. The notion of ‘individualised collective action’ is evocative here.35”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=15&annotation=XPIHVU7U) 
	 	- self-repr. 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"The criteria come under three headings: A. ‘Connecting’ criteria, which focus on the positioning of claimants within certain formal and informal structures which ‘connect’ them to institutions in a way that may bolster their democratic credentials. 35See Michele Micheletti, Political Virtue and Shopping (New York: Palgrave, 2003). 36I focus on claims within electoral democracies in part because these tend to be the harder cases to evaluate. There is much more scope for actors opposing fundamentally undemocratic governments or political orders to claim democratic legitimacy. AUTHORISATION AND AUTHENTICITY 1”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=15&annotation=XZMHMLBK) 
	 	- authorisation and authenticity 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"B. ‘Confirming’ criteria, which focus on whether ‘constituencies’ of varied kinds do or can accept claims in a way that lends them some democratic credibility. C. ‘Untaintededness’ criteria, which focus on claims located deliberately outside governmental institutions.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=16&annotation=IHI4H8AV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"Does the Claimant Occupy an Appropriate Position in the Line of Democratic Delegation?”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=16&annotation=6WN9XK6S) 
	 	- connecting 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"we might specify five positions in an ideal-typical line of delegation: (1) from voters to legislators, (2) within legislatures, (3) from legislators to executives, (4) within executives, and (5) from executives to bureaucracies.38 We might ask if a non-elective representative claimant might seek justification by asserting his or her position within such a chain of formal democratic delegation, most often within the larger structures of public management and administration.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=16&annotation=4IUBDNVQ) 
	 	- delegation 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"Is the Claim Acceptable Because It Is Embedded in a Larger Democratic System?”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=16&annotation=N3T2RXTB) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"iii. Locked in to Networks?”</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=17&annotation=9NZJDM54) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"i. Can the Representative Claim Be Tested in Principle?”</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=18&annotation=JPGMGEPN) 
	 	- confirming 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"ii. Is the Claim Accepted, or Provisionally Acceptable?”</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=18&annotation=6R9U4ABJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"Is the Claim Acceptable Precisely Because It Is Untainted by Formal Election Processes?”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=19&annotation=24NSLSNU) 
	 	- untainted 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"Is the Claim Acceptable Precisely Because It Is Untainted by Virtue of Disconnection from a State Apparatus?”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=19&annotation=N7MW96II) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Relatedly, the democratic credentials of non-elective representative claims set out in the article mirror the ‘founding paradox’ of democracy. Democratic polities, like others, require undemocratic foundings—Derrida’s ‘founding violence’.53”</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/E7PWCYET?page=21&annotation=HYA74ZJS)
