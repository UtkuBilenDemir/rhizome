> abstract:: This book examines whether the mechanisms of accountability characteristic of democratic systems are sufficient to induce the representatives to act in the best interest of the represented. The first part of the volume focuses on the role of elections, distinguishing different ways in which they may cause representation. The second part is devoted to the role of checks and balances, between the government and the parliament as well as between the government and the bureaucracy. The contributors of this volume, all leading scholars in the fields of American and comparative politics and political theory, address questions such as, whether elections induce governments to act in the interest of citizens. Are politicians in democracies accountable to voters in future elections? If so, does accountability induce politicians to represent citizens? Does accountability limit or enhance the scope of action of governments? Are governments that violate campaign mandates representative? Overall, the essays combine theoretical discussions, game-theoretic models, case studies, and statistical analyses, within a shared analytical approach and a standardized terminology. The empirical material is drawn from the well established democracies as well as from new democracies.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Yet both views are problematic. Representation is an issue because politicians have goals, interests, and values of their own, and they know things and undertake actions that citizens cannot observe or can monitor only at a cost. Even if once they are in office politicians may want to do nothing but serve the public, to get elected in the first place they may have to gratify special interests. And once elected, they may want to pursue their private goals or some public objectives that differ from those of citizens.”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=33&annotation=PWECRV62) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"In this chapter we analyze whether voters can enforce representation by using their vote to choose policies and politicians, using it to sanction the incumbent, or using their vote simultaneously in both ways. We then discuss institutional features that may be conducive to inducing representation.”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=34&annotation=223TVPC6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"(1) electoral campaigns are informative, that is, voters can justifiably expect that parties would do what they proposed, and (2) pursuing the winning platform, the “mandate,” is always in the best interest of voters.”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=34&annotation=IAL8VRIH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"As a French politician put it, “Since the Romans, it is an old law of politics, which we should never lose from our view: governments can last only by the principle by which they were born” (Séguin 1997).”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=34&annotation=IJBYA35R) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Thus, the question about mandate representation is whether (1) the policy of the incumbents will be the same as their electoral platform, and (2) whether pursuing this platform will be best for voters.”</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=35&annotation=9VG9H729) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"is it true that proportionality is the best way to secure representation?”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=36&annotation=Q3J9DDWM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"To highlight the weakness of the mandate mechanism, suppose that politicians cannot be reelected even once.8 Voters know that once elected the incumbent will do whatever he wants. Without the sanction of voting again, voters must guess which of the competing parties or candidates has policy preferences that coincide with theirs and which is impervious to the corrupting sway of office. Yet unless the pool of candidates includes such politicians and unless voters guess correctly who they are, the victorious candidates will not act in the representative manner. If they have policy preferences distinct from those of the decisive voter, they will deviate from the announced policies; if they pursue private benefits, they will extract rents”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=38&annotation=4YA4P3KJ) 
	 	- Professional representation 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Moreover, just to get elected, politicians may have to make promises to special interests. Suppose, in the spirit of the Chicago School of Regulation”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=38&annotation=4P6ZWYJ8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"(1) voters are ignorant, rationally or not, about the impact of policies on their welfare, and (2) to present themselves to voters, politicians need to expend resources, including but not limited to money.”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=38&annotation=GKBG2WSF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Politicians are concerned only with winning elections, but to win they must raise resources. Because voters do not care about policies that have only a small impact on their welfare, politicians can sell to interest groups policies that inflict only a small cost on each individual voter but which concentrate benefits on the particular interest groups and spend on electioneering the resources contributed by interest groups in exchange for these policies. Since policies that raise resources from special interests are costly to voters, politicians choose policies that make them indifferent at the margin between increasing voters’ welfare and campaign expenditures, and the welfare of voters is not maximized.”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=38&annotation=V5A6DFJM) 
	 	- A crucial downside of the electoral optimisation 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Exchanges of political contributions for policy favors are distorting through their effects on the allocation of resources. And the social cost of such distortions is likely to be much greater than that of outright theft, which is distorting only through its effect on distorting taxe”</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=39&annotation=CEM7VRPA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"1. Conditions may change in such a way that the implementation of the mandate is no longer best for voters.”</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=39&annotation=PYGYW8IZ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Two situations need to be further distinguished. In one (Harrington 1993a: sec. 4), the two candidates have the same beliefs about the preferences of the decisive voter but different beliefs about the effectiveness of policies, meaning that one of them thinks the decisive voter is wrong. Then they offer the same platform in the electoral campaign but once elected may pursue  available at http:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139175104.002  Downloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"the 1983 switch of the French Socialist government may be a case in point.”</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=40&annotation=HV22H4GP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"2. To be elected, a candidate must offer the platform preferred by the decisive voter. Suppose a candidate believes that the decisive voter has incorrect beliefs about the effect of policies on outcomes.”</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=40&annotation=8T8NVMU7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"In the second situation, the two candidates have the same beliefs about the effectiveness of policies but differ in their beliefs about the preference of the decisive voter. If elected, they pursue the same policy, but to get elected they offer different platforms.”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=41&annotation=GHJCXHJV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"3. Suppose that everything is the same as just described but the incumbent does not believe that voters will be persuaded by the effectiveness of the better policy – either because voters are quite certain which policy is better for them or because the policy choice does not make a great difference.”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=41&annotation=F6LWUSMK) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"While such reputational mechanisms may encourage the incumbents to adhere to electoral promises, a striking feature of democratic institutions, highlighted by Manin (1997), is that politicians are not legally compelled to abide by their platform in any democratic system.”</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=42&annotation=3G5BM8RV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Binding national referenda based on citizens’ initiative are found only in Switzerland and, in more restrictive forms, in Italy and Argentina. Hence, once citizens elect representatives, they have no institutional devices to force them to adhere to promises. Voters can sanction deviations from mandates only after their effects have been experienced.”</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=43&annotation=78IQ8KVP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Another historical argument was that voters may not trust their own judgments. People not only may be afraid of their own passions but, if they are rationally ignorant”</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=43&annotation=8D936EE4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Finally, institutions must allow for changing conditions. No electoral platform can specify ex ante what the government should do in every contingent state of nature;”</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=43&annotation=GAPWJ8CH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Accountability representation occurs when (1) voters vote to retain the incumbent only when the incumbent acts in their best interest, and (2) the incumbent chooses policies necessary to get reelected.”</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=44&annotation=FMT2BPAU)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"1. Voters must be able to assign clearly the responsibility for government performance. Their ability to do so is limited when the government is a coalition.”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=51&annotation=5ZBLPVBN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"2. Voters must be able to vote out of office parties responsible for bad performance, and the parties they select must be able to enter government.”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=52&annotation=288YNBJL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Po”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=52&annotation=I9LL7PI8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"3. Politicians must have incentives to want to be reelected. This condition becomes problematic when there are limitations on reeligibility, ubiquitous in presidential systems (Cheibub and Przeworski, Chapter 7 in this volume), and when political parties are not continuing bureaucratic organizations that offer their militants career prospects (Zielinski 1997).”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=52&annotation=8ZAMALJK) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"4. The opposition must monitor the performance of the government and inform citizens. Indeed, any reasonable understanding of representation must include the opposition. Citizens have two agents, not just one: the incumbents who govern and the opposition that wants to become the government.”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=52&annotation=AX7WMZXR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"5. The media, the role of which is emphasized by Arnold (1993), thus have a particular role to play.”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=53&annotation=UCX6EGYL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"6. Finally, but perhaps most importantly, voters must have some institutional instruments to reward and punish governments for outcomes they generate in different realms. Yet elections are inherently a blunt instrument of control: voters have only one decision to make with regard to the entire package of government policies.”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLWABHUK?page=53&annotation=K3L5KVG3)
