            Successive studies have found a persistent gender gap in political knowledge. Despite much international research, this gap has remained largely impervious to explanation. A promising line of recent inquiry has been the low levels of women's elected representation in many democracies. We test the hypothesis that higher levels of women's elected representation will increase women's political knowledge. Using two large, comparative data sets, we find that the proportion of women elected representatives at the time of the survey has no significant effect on the gender gap. By contrast, there is a strong and significant long‐term impact for descriptive representation when respondents were aged 18 to 21. The results are in line with political socialization, which posits that the impact of political context is greatest during adolescence and early adulthood. These findings have important implications not only for explaining the gender knowledge gap, but also for the impact of descriptive representation on political engagement generally.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Using two large, comparative data sets, we find that the proportion of women elected representatives at the time of the survey has no significant effect on the gender gap. By contrast, there is a strong and significant long-term impact for descriptive representation when respondents were aged 18 to 21.”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=&annotation=R35AISGE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Such differences would appear to have some importance in explaining different levels of political participation: For example, women were traditionally less likely than men to gain a university education, a primary determinant of participation. In addition, there remains a persistent wage gap between men and women (Cha and Weeden 2014), and the greater proportion of women heading one-parent families has made women poorer and men richer (Edlund and Pande 2002; Iversen and Rosenbluth 2006).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=2&annotation=3VHEYHZ5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"There is evidence that it has been a factor in the gradual shift among women toward a center-left affiliation, away from their traditional center-right affiliation (Iversen and Rosenbluth 2006; McAllister 2011).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=3&annotation=LWIKGE9L) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"A second explanation for the gender gap in political knowledge is political interest and the associated patterns of media attentiveness. Women have been shown to be consistently less interested in politics than men, even after a wide range of other factors, most notably education, have been taken into account (Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=3&annotation=95Q3XJVN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"the descriptive representation that exists at the time of the survey will translate into a particular level of political knowledge across the electorate as a whole. There are good reasons, however, to doubt the validity of this assumption.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=3&annotation=YPQ8APYG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Building on this research, we argue that the impact of descriptive representation should be greatest among adolescents and young adults.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=4&annotation=2NAKEQII) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Our hypothesis, then, is that female respondents who entered the electorate at a time when more women were represented in politics will have similar levels of political knowledge when compared to men.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=4&annotation=3QT8NRA2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"We use two data sets that meet these requirements and that complement one another: the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) and the 2009 European Election Study (EES)”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=4&annotation=SL3VFJP2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Our focus is on the number of correct answers—rescaled to run from 0 to 1—that respondents provide on the political knowledge items that were included in the respective data sets.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=5&annotation=I7FVK7P8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"We have validated the knowledge scales by calculating Cronbach’s alpha statistics for each specific election/country-study. Cronbach’s alpha values can vary between 0 and 1, and the cut-off point that is usually referred to as the minimal value for a reliable scale (i.e., a scale measuring a one-dimensional construct) is about .60 (DeBell 2013).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=5&annotation=IXNW8FEH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"In addition, given that the knowledge items are meant to vary in their level of difficulty, we also calculated Loevinger’s H-values for each subsample (Mondak and Anderson 2004). This measure assumes the scale has an underlying cumulative structure. Values on this measure can vary from 0 to 1, with values between .30 and .40 indicating a weak scale, values between .40 and .50 suggesting a medium scale, and values greater than .50 indicating a strong scale (Mokken and Lewis 1982).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=5&annotation=6QMVMGNG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The first model serves to benchmark the size of the gender gap and does not include interactions between gender and the percentage of women in parliament. The second model adds an interaction between respondents’ gender and the percentage of women in parliament at the time of the survey. Finally, the third model adds an interaction between respondents’ gender and the percentage of women in parliament when respondents were aged between 18 and 21 years.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=8&annotation=TVI8LZ8U) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The results presented here confirm the persistent finding that women have lower levels of conventional political knowledge when compared to men.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=14&annotation=3F8AXAM8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Our hypothesis is that this gender gap in political knowledge will be reduced by the descriptive representation of women in politics.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=14&annotation=6368L2AY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Our results show that increased descriptive representation does not have a short-term effect on women’s levels of political knowledge. Instead, we find that descriptive representation has a long-term impact; it leaves an imprint on young adults who are voting in their first election. This is in line with political socialization theory, which has shown that the influence of political context is strongest among those who are in the process of entering the electorate.12”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=14&annotation=RCBZXKBF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"men see fewer of “their” own group in office, they become less politically engaged and knowledgeable. This explanation accords with how descriptive representation influences women, but more research is needed into the causal processes that underlie it, and how it may affect men.14”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=15&annotation=2YHIXS24) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Our findings have two implications for future studies of gender and politics. First and most important, the descriptive representation of women matters. As others have argued, more women role models in politics will decrease the gender knowledge gap (Carroll 1994; Sanbonmatsu 2002; Wolbrecht and Campbell 2007). Ultimately, such changes will create a more equitable political system and further reduce gender differences in many aspects of political attitudes and behavior. Second, our results suggest that such change will take many generations before it has any significant impact on a political system. Since the influence of descriptive representation is effective through the imprint it leaves on young adults, it will only be when substantial numbers of voters—socialized in a context of strong women’s political representation—have moved into the electorate that overall patterns of engagement will change.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PXPCYGI?page=15&annotation=TQYBVPNK)
