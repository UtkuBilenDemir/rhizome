> abstract:: In recent times, representation theory has become one of the most productive and interesting sub-fields in democratic theory. Arguably, the most important theoretical innovation are the so-called ‘constructivist’ approaches to political representation. These approaches play a central role in Creating Political Presence: The New Politics of Democratic Representation and The Constructivist Turn in Political Representation, two impressive volumes that take stock of the state of the art in representation theory. I discuss the two volumes by focusing on three broader and interconnected themes: the problem that constructivism is meant to respond to, the tendency of representation theorists to expand the possibilities of representation as broadly as possible, and the normative aspects of political representation and how constructivists deal with them.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In this short piece, I want to discuss what I take to be the key ideas and arguments presented in the two volumes. Since I cannot possibly do justice to the full breadth of approaches presented in CPP and CT, I will structure my discussion around three broader and interconnected themes: 1. The problem that the new theories of representation are meant to be a response to, that is, globalisation and the crisis of representative democracy. 2. The tendency of representation theorists to expand the possibilities of representation and the signification of the term as broadly as possible. 3. The normative aspects of political representation and how the new representation theories deal with them”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N3Y3T9IV?page=2&annotation=LYCEQVDE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Of course, the conclusion that it would be rash to unquestioningly accept the notion that conventional domestic politics is rendered much less relevant by globalisation does not disallow constructivism. Quite the contrary, it is possible to endorse the broader constructivist agenda while rejecting (some of) the diagnostic arguments that are being put forward in order to justify that agenda.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N3Y3T9IV?page=4&annotation=JBGULRJY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In sum, I suggest there are three main takeaway points. First, representation theorists would do well to pay more attention to conventional representative institutions, the specific institutional design challenges they face, and how they could support the contestation of representative claims. Second, theorists should also ask more often to what extent political representation is connected to power. Finally, and more positively, there can be no doubt that the ‘constructivist turn’ provides us with enormously useful theoretical resources for studying political representation”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N3Y3T9IV?page=10&annotation=3272JZI9)
