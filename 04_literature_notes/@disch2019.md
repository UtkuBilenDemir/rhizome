> abstract:: This is the first edited volume to provide a comprehensive introduction and a critical exploration of the
              constructivist turn
              in political representation. Divided into three thematic parts, the 13 newly commissioned essays presented here develop
              constructivist turn
              as a central concept advancing the insight that there can be no democratic politics without representation because constituencies, or groups, exist as agents of democratic politics only insofar as they are represented. Complete with an original English translation of ‚ÄòDemocracy and Representation‚Äô by the French philosopher Claude Lefort, this volume delivers a rich critical intervention in democratic theory.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Representation involves a principal-agent relationship (the representatives ‚Äòstood for‚Äô and ‚Äòacted on behalf of‚Äô the represented), mostly although not exclusively on a territorial basis, so that governments could be said to be responsive to the interests and opinions of the people constituted by territorial membership. 2. Representative roles have specified places within political decision-making structures, formalised in constitutional law. Representation identifies locations for political power to be exercised responsibly and with a degree of accountability, in large part by enabling citizens to have some influence upon and exercise some control over it. 3. The right to vote for representatives provides a simple means and measure of political equality, comprised as distributed empowerments to select and recall.‚Äù</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KS2PU6JQ?page=1&annotation=KKDJFUWT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"It has long been recognised, of course, that these representative relationships are complex both in meaning and in practice (Pitkin 1967).‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KS2PU6JQ?page=2&annotation=87MI68FU)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"oblematise large-scale, mass democratic institutions. Yet contemporary democracies have evolved in ways that increasingly undermine the adequacy of the standard model. Two of these involve the scale and complexity in processes of decision-making in modern societies: 1. The emergence of transnational decision-making arenas, where new international and global players operate, tends to escape the reach of territorially democratic representation, as do the increasing number of issues that are non-territorial in nature (Rehfeld 2005; Grant and Keohane 2005; Bohman 2007). 2. An increasing number of collective decision-making areas and issues, at both the national and supranational level, are now under the control of specialised and expert bodies, with only loose connections to the traditional institutions of political representation, and often lacking a place for the voice, influence and control of those affected (Zolo 1992; Beck 1997; Brown 2006).‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KS2PU6JQ?page=2&annotation=XHYDAL9P)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Two other changes have to do with the ways people relate to their political communities: 1. The simple political egalitarianism on which the institutions and mechanisms of modern representative democracy were established has given way to increasing demands for group recognition as well as for forms of equality related directly to people‚Äôs needs, characteristics, identities and conditions (Taylor 1994; Phillips 1995; Williams 1998; Young 2000). These developments have produced 5937_Disch.indd 22 .i 12/12/18 4:54 P‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KS2PU6JQ?page=2&annotation=YWYT2WWV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"rethinking democratic representation 23 a more complex discourse of representation, for which simple egalitarian standards embedded in the standard model no longer seem adequate. 2. There has been a diffusion of more informal structures and opportunities for democratic representation and influence. This development partly reflects the diminished role of formal political structures in social decision-making, but also the increasing diversification of the forms of association in modern societies, post-material ideals and culture, as well as increasingly dense and complex forms of public discourse (Beck 1997; Offe 1996; Warren 2001).‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KS2PU6JQ?page=3&annotation=4W5LTDEA)
