what had taken him over was the will to live, unadulterated, irresistible, pure, and the first thing it did was to inform him that it wanted nothing to do with his pathetic personality, that half-reconstructed affair of mimicry and voices, it intended to bypass all that, and he found himself surrendering to it, yes, go on, as if he were a bystander in his own mind, in his own body, — location: [103]() ^ref-17568

In Bombay, Zeenat Vakil stretched and yawned and drove other women from his thoughts. "Too much," she laughed at him. "They pay you to imitate them, as long as they don't have to look at you.

Chamcha's irritation would get the better of him. The seventh time that Farishta quoted the old Gramsci chestnut, Saladin shouted out in frustration, maybe that's what's happening to you, loudmouth, your old self is dying and that dream-angel of yours is trying to be born into your flesh. — location: [1270]() ^ref-30005

Just as he, the businessman, felt when he first saw the archangel: thought he was cracked, wanted to throw himself down from a rock, from a high rock, from a rock on which there grew a stunted lote-tree, a rock as high as the roof of the world. He's coming: making his way up Cone Mountain to the cave. Happy birthday: he's forty-four today. But though the city behind and below 95 him throngs with festival, up he climbs, alone. No new birthday suit for him, neatly pressed and folded at the foot of his bed. A man of ascetic tastes. (What strange manner of businessman is this?) Question: What is the opposite of faith? Not disbelief. Too final, certain, closed. Itself a kind of belief. Doubt. — location: [1329]() ^ref-61419

Exile is a vision of revolution: Elba, not St Helena. It is an endless paradox: looking forward by always looking back. The exile is a ball hurled high into the air.

passion, and while secularist Sufyan swallowed the multiple cultures of the subcontinent -- "and let us not pretend that Western culture is not present; after these centuries, how could it not also be part of our heritage?" -- his wife cooked, and ate in increasing quantities, its food. As she devoured the highly spiced dishes of Hyderabad and the high-faluting yoghurt sauces of Lucknow her body began to alter, because all that food had to find a home somewhere, and she began to resemble the 256 wide rolling land mass itself, the subcontinent without frontiers, because food passes across any boundary you care to mention. Mr. Muhammad Sufyan, however, gained no weight: not a _tola_, not an _ounce_. His refusal to fatten was the beginning of the trouble. When she reproached him -- "You don't like my cooking? For whom I'm doing it all and blowing up like a balloon?" -- he answered, mildly, looking up at her (she was the taller of the two) over the top of half-rimmed specs: "Restraint is also part of our traditions, Begum. — location: [3623]() ^ref-46882

"In which even great Charles accepted the notion of mutation in extremis, to ensure survival of species; so what if his followers -- always more Darwinian than man himselfl -- repudiated, posthumously, such Lamarckian heresy, insisting on natural selection and nothing but, -- however, I am bound to admit, such theory is not extended to survival of individual specimen but only to species as a whole; -- in addition, regarding nature of mutation, problem is to comprehend actual utility of the change." — location: [3711]() ^ref-20859

She went icy. "Chamcha, listen up. I'll discuss this with you one time because behind all your bulishit you do maybe care for me a little. So comprehend, please, that I am an intelligent female. I have read _Finnegans Wake_ and am conversant with postmodernist critiques of the West, e.g. that we have here a society capable only of pastiche: a 'flattened' world. When I become the voice of a bottle of bubble bath, I am entering Flatland knowingly, understanding what I'm doing and why. Viz., I am earning cash. And as an intelligent woman, able to do fifteen minutes on Stoicism and more on Japanese cinema, I say to you, Chamcha, that I am fully aware of Billy boy's rep. Don't teach me about exploitation. We had exploitation when youplural were running round 273 in skins. Try being Jewish, female and ugly sometime. You'll beg to be black. Excuse my French: brown." "You — location: [3872]() ^ref-18165

"This is pretty cold comfort," Chamcha managed a trace of his old dryness. "Either I accept Lucretius and conclude that some demonic and irreversible mutation is taking place in my inmost depths, or I go with Ovid and concede that everything now emerging is no more than a manifestation of what was already there." — location: [4129]() ^ref-63832

No power-base, no constituency: just the battle with the words_. But he, Jumpy, also had to admit that his envy of Hanif was as much as anything rooted in the other's greater control of the languages of desire. Mishal Sufyan was quite something, an elongated, tubular beauty, but he wouldn't have known how, even if he'd thought of, he'd never have dared.

Jumpy en route to his mistress tried to convince himself that his resentments of Hanif, _his friend Hanif_, were primarily -- how to put it? -- _linguistic_. Hanif was in perfect control of the languages that mattered: sociological, socialistic, black--radical, anti--anti-- anti-- racist, demagogic, oratorical, sermonic: the vocabularies of power. _But you bastard you rummage in my drawers and laugh at my stupid poems. The real language problem: how to bend it shape it, how to let it be our freedom, how to repossess its poisoned wells, how to master the river of words of time of blood: about all that you haven't got a clue_. How hard that struggle, how inevitable the defeat. _Nobody's going to elect me to anything. No power-base, no constituency: just the battle with the words_. But he, Jumpy, also had to admit that his envy of Hanif was as much as anything rooted in the other's greater control of the languages of desire.

He might have told her, that night, that he wanted to end it, that his conscience no longer permitted, -- he might have been willing to face her rage, and to live with the paradox that a decision could be simultaneously conscientious and immoral (because cruel, unilateral, selfish); but when he entered the bedroom she grabbed his face with both hands, and watching closely to see how he took the news she confessed to having lied about contraceptive precautions. She was pregnant. It turned out she was better at making unilateral decisions than he, and had simply taken from him the child Saladin Chamcha had been unable to provide. "I wanted it," she cried defiantly, and at close range. "And now I'm going to have it." Her selfishness had pre-empted his. He discovered that he felt relieved; absolved of the responsibility for making and acting upon moral choices, -- because how could he leave her now? -- he put such notions out of his head and allowed her, gently but with unmistakable intent, to push him backwards on to the bed. — location: [4208]() ^ref-35393

He was looking for someone to blame. He, too, dreamed; and in his dreams, a shape, a face, was floating closer, ghostly still, unclear, but one day soon he would be able to call it by its name. _I am_, he accepted, _that I am_. Submission. — location: [4323]() ^ref-12572

Attendants move towards the tableau of hate-figures, pounce upon the night's sacrificial offering, the one most often selected, if truth be told; at least three times a week. Her permawaved coiffure, her pearls, her suit of blue. _Maggie-maggie-maggie_, bays the crowd. _Burn-burn-burn_. The doll, -- the _guy_, -- is strapped into the Hot Seat. Pinkwalla throws the switch. And O how prettily she melts, from the inside out, crumpling into formlessness. Then she is a puddle, and the crowd sighs its ecstasy: done. "The fire this time," Pinkwalla tells them. Music regains the night. — location: [4386]() ^ref-51204

"This's what I learned in the revolution," she went on.

So how do we know if it's right or wrong? We don't even know what it is. So what I thought was, you can either break your heart trying to work it all out, or you can go sit on a mountain, because that's where all the truth went, believe it or not, it just upped and ran away from these cities where even the stuff under our feet is all made up, a lie, and it hid up there in the thin thin air where the liars don't dare come after it in case their brains explode.

Gibreel said, quietly. She hung upon his arm. "Truly, I don't think you're really well." He stood upon his dignity. "Having commanded my exit, you no longer have jurisdiction re my health." He made his escape. — location: [4815]() ^ref-13382

"You'll be interested in this." He quickly identified it as a racist text demanding the "repatriation" of the country's black citizenry. She took him, he deduced, for a white angel. So angels were not exempt from such categories, he wonderingly learned. "Look at it this way," the woman was saying, taking his silence for uncertainty -- and revealing, by slipping into an overarticulated, over-loud mode of delivery, that she thought him not quite pukka, a Levantine angel, maybe, Cypriot or Greek, in need of her best talking--to--the--afflicted voice.

Mahound, any new idea is asked two questions. When it's weak: will it compromise? We know the answer to that one. And now, Mahound, on your return to Jahilia, time for the second question: How do you behave when you win? When your enemies are at your mercy and your power has become absolute: what then? We have all changed: all of us except Hind. Who seems, from what this drunkard says, more like a woman of Yathrib than Jahilia. No wonder the two of you didn't hit it off: she wouldn't be your mother or your child. — location: [5578]() ^ref-53039

"What will you do now?" Mishal had asked him amid the wreckage of the Hot Wax nightclub, and he'd answered, too lightly: "Me? I think I'll come back to life." Easier said than done; it was life, after all, that had rewarded his love of a dream--child with childlessness; his love of a woman, with her estrangement from him and her insemination by his old college friend; his love of a city, by hurling him down towards it from Himalayan heights; and his love of a civilization, by having him bedevilled, humiliated, broken upon its wheel. Not quite broken, he reminded himself; he was whole again, and there was, too, the example of Niccolô Machiavelli to consider (a wronged man, his name, like that of Muhammad-Mahon-Mahound, a synonym for evil; whereas in fact his staunch republicanism had earned him the rack, upon which he survived, was it three turns of the wheel? -- enough, at any — location: [6028]() ^ref-47917

And evolution theory had come a long way since Darwin. It was now being argued that major changes in species happened not in the stumbling, hit-andmiss manner first envisaged, but in great, radical leaps. The history of life was not the bumbling progress -- the very English middleclass progress -- Victorian thought had wanted it to be, but violent, a thing of dramatic, cumulative transformations: in the old formulation, more revolution than evolution. -- I've heard enough, the cabbie said.
