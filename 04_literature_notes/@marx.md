- <mark class="hltr-orange">"From political economy itself, using its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity, and moreover the most wretched commodity of all; that the misery of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and volume of his production; that the necessary consequence of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands and hence the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; and that, finally, the distinction between capitalist and landlord, between agricultural worker and industrial worker, disappears and the whole of society must split into the two classes of property owners and propertyless workers.”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUXMIKXQ?page=&annotation=ESVNPG4T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"For example, when it defines the relation of wages to profit, it takes the interests of the capitalists as the basis of its analysis — i.e., it assumes what it is supposed to explain.”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUXMIKXQ?page=&annotation=HTZTQUHV) 
	 	- It assumes what it supposed to explain 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"The only wheels which political economy sets in motion are greed, and the war of the avaricious, competition.”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUXMIKXQ?page=&annotation=U2KR9U2E) 
	 	- This is still the humanist marx, which Engels largely adopts and preserves 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUXMIKXQ?page=&annotation=SCH4BIPW) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"commodities he produces. The devaluation of the human world grows in direct proportion to the increase in value of the world of things.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUXMIKXQ?page=2&annotation=QKK4UNCC)
