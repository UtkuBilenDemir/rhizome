> abstract:: A revolutionary new textbook introducing masters and doctoral students to the major research approaches and methodologies in the social sciences. Written by an outstanding set of scholars, and derived from successful course teaching, this volume will empower students to choose their own approach to research, to justify this approach, and to situate it within the discipline. It addresses questions of ontology, epistemology and philosophy of social science, and proceeds to issues of methodology and research design essential for producing a good research proposal. It also introduces researchers to the main issues of debate and contention in the methodology of social sciences, identifying commonalities, historic continuities and genuine differences.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"King, Keohane and Verba (1994: 6) synthesized the ‘ideal to which any actual quantitative and qualitative research’ should aim in the following definition of ‘scientific research’: 1 The goal is inference. Scientific research is designed to make descriptive or explanatory inferences on the bases of empirical information about the world . . . 2 The procedures are public. Scientific research uses explicit, codified, and public methods to generate and analyse data whose reliability can therefore be assessed . . . 3 The conclusions are uncertain . . . 4 The content is the method. . . . scientific research adheres to a set of rules of inference on which its validity depends.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=2&annotation=V993KXFM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"For nominalists, categories only exist because we arbitrarily create them. For realists,2 the categories are there to be discovered.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=3&annotation=KWNWFTFA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Again, the question arises also in the natural sciences; but they have shared standards of evidence, argument and logic. This is not so in the social sciences, with some social scientists calling for objective evidence akin to that of the natural sciences, while others insist that other forms of knowledge are possible.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=4&annotation=S9N5DFXI)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In neo-positivism and then post-positivism, these assumptions are relaxed. Reality is still considered to be objective (external to human minds), but it is only imperfectly knowable.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=6&annotation=TDGC56BS) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"If positivism closely resembles the traditional scientific method (or Newtonian physics) in its search for regularities, post-positivism is closer to modern scientific approaches, which accept a degree of uncertainty.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=6&annotation=CI4INANZ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"‘Social constructionists tend to maintain that classifications are not determined by how the world is but are convenient ways to represent it.’”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=6&annotation=FGRMNLPH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The world is not just there to be discovered by empirical research; rather, knowledge is filtered through the theory the researcher adopts.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=6&annotation=FPYLDA9N) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Interpretation works at two levels. The world can be understood not as an objective reality, but as a series of interpretations that people within society give of their position; the social scientist, in turn, interprets these interpretations.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=7&annotation=3B54SBT4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In a further reflexive turn, social scientists’ interpretations feed back to the people through literature and media, influencing them yet again in what Giddens (1976) calls the ‘double hermeneutic’. This is one reason why relationships that may have held in the past might not hold in the future (Hay 2002).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=7&annotation=U24GWSUT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"‘Not an experimental science in search of laws but an interpretative science in search of meaning’.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=7&annotation=4EVF6F8W) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In the most radical versions of this approach, reality does not exist beyond the (relative and partial) images the various actors have of it. Knowing the reality is therefore impossible, and scholars should focus on the meaning through empathetic knowledge.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=7&annotation=NM599EE5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In the positivist tradition, research aims at singling out causal explanations, on the assumption of a cause–effect relationship between variables (see Héritier, ch. 4).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=8&annotation=NKL743TC) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Positivists in the more scientific tradition, however, would insist that one start with a theory, which then generates hypotheses (an expected state of affairs) which are then subjected to the test of hard facts and only accepted if they survive the ordeal (see Héritier, ch. 4).9”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=8&annotation=FFT65W24) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"This is the hypothetico-deductive (deductive-empirical) method,10 in which the study of social reality utilizes the conceptual framework, techniques of observation and measurement, instruments of mathematical analysis and procedures of inference of the natural sciences (Corbetta 2003: 13).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=8&annotation=HZCCG38X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"By contrast, interpretive/qualitative research aims at understanding events by discovering the meanings human beings attribute to their behaviour and the external world.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=8&annotation=UKH6K9W3) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In the form of 26 Donatella della Porta and Michael Keating https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511801938.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pres”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=8&annotation=PBIF2XM9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"‘grounded theory’, it may be built up in the course of the research, but then be available for further research and the study of other cases. Cases are not broken down into variables but considered as interdependent wholes; generalization is achieved by assigning cases to classes and approximating them to ideal types.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=9&annotation=2GVUB9YT)
