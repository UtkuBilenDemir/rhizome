> abstract:: This article explores the relationship between non-electoral representatives and democratic legitimacy by combining the recent constructivist turn in political representation with systemic work in deliberative theory. Two core arguments are advanced. First, non-electoral representatives should be judged by their position in a wider democratic system. Second, deliberative democracy offers a productive toolkit by which to evaluate these agents. I develop a framework of systemic representation which depicts the elemental parts of a democratic system and assigns normative standards according to the space occupied. The framework gives priority of democratic analysis to the systemic level. This helps mitigate a central concern in the constructivist turn which suggests that representatives mobilize constituencies in ways that are susceptible to framing and manipulation. I engage in case-study analysis of the collapsed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement to unpack the different spaces occupied by non-electoral representative and elucidate the varied democratic demands that hinge on this positioning.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"First, I contend that nonelectoral representatives should be judged by their position in a wider system. A democratic system is composed of three key elements: the empowered space, the public space, and transmission belts between the two.2‚Äù</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=1&annotation=9PR3I24I)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Second, I submit that deliberative democracy offers a better theoretical framework to evaluate nonelectoral representatives compared to alternatives proffered in the current literature. Precisely because these actors articulate representational claims and mobilize constituencies through discursive practice, deliberative democracy offers a robust theoretical toolkit.‚Äù</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=1&annotation=R2GLPLIW) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I argue that assessments of democratic legitimacy must go beyond the representativeconstituency dyad and instead occur at the systemic level by reference to subjected actors.‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=2&annotation=RRLC83FW) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Hanna Pitkin (1967, 140), in her influential account, stated that representatives should ‚Äúmake present again‚Äù the views of the citizenry. To ensure congruence, elections enable a constituency (a predefined demos)toauthorize and hold accountable their representatives. Pitkin‚Äôs ‚Äústandard account‚Äù of representation has bordered upon hegemonic in political science.‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=2&annotation=J2AIZLL6) 
	- Is it really like that? 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"This turn rests on two foundations: first, representation should be conceptualized as an ongoing process of performative claim-making (Saward 2010); second, representation is constitutive of popular power rather than the other way around (N  Ãà asstr  Ãà om 2015).‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=3&annotation=9894FFI7) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"a maker of representations puts forward a subject which stands for an object which is related to a referent and is offered to an audience. Claim-making also invokes a constituency which is the set of actors that the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù speaks for (sometimes, though not always, the referent). Through a continual process of discursive claim-making, constituencies and audiences are actualized by representatives who identify, call forth, organize, and shape latent interests.‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=3&annotation=SLGFQZRE)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Instead of looking for a range of mechanisms that substitute for electoral mechanisms of authorization and accountability, Dryzek‚Äôs (2009) notion of deliberative capacity is fruitful.10 First, deliberation demands equal inclusion.‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W2CNKFSG?page=6&annotation=848A7JMK)
