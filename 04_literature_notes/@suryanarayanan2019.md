- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Despite these observations, most agree that these are secondary factors that do not entirely explain why beehives become susceptible in the first place (vanEngelsdorp et al. 2009). While bee scientists believe that in the case of CCD, “Multiplicity rules” (Delaplane 2009, 1057), the complex of factors responsible for CCD and how they interact to produce the phenomenon remain uncertain, and the identities of the most involved factors remain mired in controversy (USDA 2013).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=2&annotation=A2FKNDR2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"CCD is the product of cocktails of chemicals, pathogens and nutritional factors interacting over time. The effects of insecticides like imidacloprid, he suspects, are “sublethal.” They don’t kill bees on contact, and a direct laboratory test that seeks to ascertain the level at which this insecticide kills bees will miss any long-term weakening of bee immune systems that could result from ongoing low-level exposure of bees to the insecticide (Walker 2010).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=3&annotation=I6XVAR5H) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"n giving voice to their approach and claims, we depict how some beekeepers develop knowledge of CCD based on their experiences of the actual field conditions in which honeybees are managed for commercial pollination. Next, we examine a second group of beekeepers, so-called scientific beekeepers. According to influential practitioners such as Randy Oliver, the uncontrolled and imprecise ways in which the first group of beekeepers follows their honeybees produces information that is at best anecdotal and inconclusive. We distinguish how these “scientific beekeepers” approach CCD and how their experiences have led them to suggest that parasite-pathogen interactions are primarily responsible. From this group, we turn our attention to the understandings of a third group of beekeepers, who claim that CCD is practically nonexistent and is in fact “piss poor beekeeping.””</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=8&annotation=93AJZMTS)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Bayer, a major producer of systemic insecticides. Why would the company remove its product from the market in the absence of definitive evidence that it causes harm?”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=13&annotation=XHK39YV8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Similarly, while growers depend on beekeepers, their worries about their crops and their livelihoods make it unlikely they would reduce their use of systemic insecticides without definitive evidence that it is hurting honeybees.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=13&annotation=ADQW2M9Q) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In sum, the nature of the knowledge (and ignorance) produced in the case of CCD reflects the accumulation and interaction of the histories, cultures, norms, interests, and practices of the various actors involved. This configuration results in the widespread legitimacy of certain knowledge claims (those advanced by entomologists) and our ignorance about the plausibility of other claims (those made by some beekeepers), which, given the established norms and practices followed by the scientists and regulators involved, have not been fully explored. This is no government or corporate cover-up but a state of affairs biased against the systematic exploration of complexity in the face of uncertainty.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=14&annotation=SVEW6F6S) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In his opinion, most of the experimental beehives, both untreated and treated (with pesticides), had “poor brood patterns”; just because a beehive had a laying queen and large amounts of brood, honey, and pollen did not necessarily mean that it was healthy.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=15&annotation=ZUWRHAC4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Even though several commercial beekeepers agree with the scientific consensus that CCD is a complex multifactorial phenomenon, beekeepers like Clint Walker point to the newer systemic insecticides as playing a central role amid a cocktail of secondary contributing factors. Their position on CCD is shaped by two noteworthy historical factors. First, beekeepers have experienced a century-long history of tensions and perceived problems in their beekeeping operations due to growers’ use of insecticides (see Root and Root 1920; vanEngelsdorp and Meixner 2010).”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=22&annotation=LIVUT8J9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"in CCD have been fueled by reports of similar honeybee collapses at the turn of the twentieth century in France. “Mad bee disease,” as the honeybee colony collapses in France came to be known, garnered coverage in beekeeping trade magazines and sparked debates between beekeepers in online forums of the U.S. beekeeping industry.”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=22&annotation=TNI4435T) 
	 	- So, it is noz zhe first 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Looking at their own experiences and following the lead of French beekeepers, several commercial beekeepers in the United States have called for the precautionary suspension of neonicotinoids.”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=23&annotation=2F9YEJR3) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Oliver went on to observe that “it was stunning” to see how these beehives, inoculated with the viral cocktail, went through the same symptoms “in an eye blink” as hives believed to have CCD (field notes, 8/16/10). This was presumably solely due to the experimentally induced infection, as his test-yard bees had received no mite-killing pesticides and were apparently surrounded by organic farms, which reduced the likelihood of exposure to agricultural chemicals. According to Oliver, “It is clear that colony collapse can be initiated . . . simply by the introduction of one or more virulent strains of virus” (2010d, 871; our emphasis).”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=25&annotation=S894Z37W) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"“I was raised to be tough as hell so I sucked it up rebuilt with my own money and learned what changes I had to make so I could survive!” The increased rental prices for beehives in California in the wake of beekeepers suffering from CCD (which is PPB in Michael’s reading) leads Michael to laughingly assert that it is best not to “give any advice out that will help keep bees alive,” since “they (the so-called PPBers) will keep me in business for years to come” (beekeeper-scientist exchanges 2009). Again, one sees here the elements of a libertarian language in which the market and competition, not science or the government, will ultimately help solve beekeepers’ problems.”</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=30&annotation=4MIU47R7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The first group of beekeepers we introduced has confidence in their own capacity to understand CCD based on data they gather observing their own beehives, and their data filtered through their own livelihood stakes provide the foundation for their policy position on systemic insecticides and CCD. This group has engaged in systematic in situ field observations, and on the basis of their field data as well as suggestive laboratory and field studies by entomologists, they have concluded that the increasingly widespread use of newer kinds of systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid and clothianidin is likely a central contributor to CCD.”</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=30&annotation=LWUQGI3V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Self-proclaimed scientific beekeepers take a different position on how to produce knowledge about CCD, what counts as knowledge, and what causes CCD. They command enormous credibility largely due to their acknowledged capacity to relay the widely accepted findings of scientists and promote practices consistent with the norms of traditional science to beekeeper audiences. They believe that the approach taken by traditional scientists is the only appropriate way to understand CCD and that public policy concerning CCD should be based on conclusive data drawn from scientific studies, not on the in situ, suggestive data derived from the observations of beekeepers. They dismiss the assessments provided by NHBAB beekeepers and the approach those beekeepers have taken to data collection. This group of beekeepers contends that CCD is primarily the result of interactions between parasites and pathogens, with newer systemic insecticides playing a negligible role.”</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=31&annotation=4M7BPAXR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"A final group of commercial beekeepers do not even consider CCD to be real, but simply a case of “piss-poor beekeeping.” Their knowledge, viewed through a lens of libertarian ideology, is based on observations of their own bees and how these bees fare in response adjustments to their beekeeping practices made in light of the existing economic and agricultural environment.”</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=31&annotation=FMIVBB5Q) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"These different beekeepers’ knowledge claims and policy orientations must be understood in the context of widely accepted notions of science and politics and the boundary between them. What we can know, how we can know it, and who can acquire and assess knowledge are defined in this environment. Here, traditional entomological science is widely understood as the most effective—the sharpest and most precise and accurate—way to obtain knowledge about the natural world and as value-free and separate from politics.”</mark> [Page 32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=32&annotation=TKLH5FA9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"Thus, the NHBAB’s beekeepers call for more science and less politics in the EPA’s regulation of pesticides.”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RXGSDBVU?page=33&annotation=KCZATLMX)
