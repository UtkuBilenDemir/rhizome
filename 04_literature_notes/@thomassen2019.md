- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Laclau’s theory of representation breaks with conventional approaches in two ways: first, representation is a general category; and, second, representation is constitutive of what is represented, whether it is the interests of the people or the identities of social groups.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=5&annotation=62ZBII24) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Representation is conceived as a surface reflecting an underlying essence: the class character of contemporary capitalist society.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=5&annotation=8HJKBDPH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"This is so because “the practice of representation” is reduced to a secondary and derivative status.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=5&annotation=IJY8VKY7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In his later work, Laclau developed a more systematic theory of representation as performative and constitutive.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=6&annotation=77FLB2ML) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Constructing a ‘people’ is not simply the application to a particular case of a general theory of representation which could be formalized at a more abstract level; it is, on the contrary, a paradigmatic case, because it is the one which reveals representation for what it is: the primary terrain of constitution of social objectivity.34”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=7&annotation=MSWGXN3K) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"For Laclau, populism – and any discourse in which the construction of a people is central, for instance fascism – are phenomena that Marxist theory cannot account for, and which Marxist practice has difficulties dealing with, because Marxist theory and practice takes representation to be the reflection of already constituted interests.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=7&annotation=8A9K8B84) 
	 	- Marxism sees the faascism as an extension of the capitalism. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In the context of debates about populism, it is the constitutive character of representation that makes Marxists and liberals wary of populist representations of the people. For Marxists, populists manipulate the working class into thinking they are first and foremost part of the people and divided from the working class in other countries; for liberals, populists manipulate citizens to think that they are divided into a “true” people and a “corrupt” one, and that they are not all in the same boat defined by liberal democratic institutions. Laclau agrees with Marxists about the antagonistic nature of politics, but he disagrees with them on the nature of antagonism; he disagrees with liberals because he thinks that they do not acknowledge the inherently antagonistic nature of politics and society.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=7&annotation=DIXY5FCW) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"With Laclau we get a general theory of representation as performative. However, I would like to address three closely connected issues with Laclau’s theory of representation. They concern (a) what is beyond representation, (b) the plasticity of representation, and (c) the sovereignty of the representative. All of these issues are important for how we understand populism and the representation of the people.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=7&annotation=REWIPFA4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Here we can think of Derrida’s work on the performative, where the performative is interpreted as iteration, that is, as re-articulation or rerepresentation. What is more, the performative representation gets its force from citing representations of, for instance, the people that are already taken as authoritative.38”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=8&annotation=499IMFGX) 
	 	- a 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Representation takes place in this partly sedimented, partly floating terrain. whether the result of a representative claim is to reproduce existing meanings or to change them, representation starts from and is limited by existing representations.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=9&annotation=2W9L77SP) 
	 	- b 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"What is more, naming only works insofar as it draws on existing names and norms, and insofar as it is recognized by others as an act of naming.44 Pure naming, if it were possible, would be a kind of private language that would not resonate with others. Naming always takes place within an already partly sedimented terrain that limits what can meaningfully be named in one way or another. This is the challenge facing left-wing populists in Europe where “populism” and speaking in the name of “the people” are usually associated with right-wing populism and even fascism. As a result, even the left-populist Podemos, which is inspired by Laclau’s theory of populism, have avoided representing themselves as populist.45”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=9&annotation=SAKSHMBX) 
	 	- c 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Müller writes of populism that it “is something like a permanent shadow of modern representative democracy, and a constant peril.”87 With Laclau, I have argued that, insofar as it shows the representational character of the people of democracy, populism is indeed a permanent shadow of democracy. But it is a shadow that does not so much threaten democracy as disclose how it works. The risk of anti-pluralism associated with populism is not specific to populism, but a risk of any discourse, including democratic ones.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=15&annotation=PTEKJQ6N) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Where does that leave those who want popular mobilization, but not in the form of right-wing populism? Müller believes we are faced with a choice between, on one side, neoliberal technocracy or populism and, on the other side, a combination of liberal democracy and social-democracy. He proposes “democratic activism” as a way to ensure that the latter does not turn into the former.88”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JS3YJN8Y?page=15&annotation=BNAVYEEP)
