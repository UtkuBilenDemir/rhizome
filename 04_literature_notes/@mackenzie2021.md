- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Ervin Goffman’s famous ethnographic work on total institutions”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=&annotation=K5IKJV2C) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For Deleuze, the emergence of control society is a process that  begins with the crisis of disciplinary institutions.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=2&annotation=FD7FIIRN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Indeed, Hardt puts it well when  he notes: ‘the walls of the institutions are breaking down in such a way that their  disciplinary logics do not become ineffective but are rather generalized in fluid  forms across the social field’ (Hardt, 1998, p. 139).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=2&annotation=SUT6XIPT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"a) charting the well-known distinction Deleuze draws between  disciplinary and control societies (in particular the shift from regimes of  individuation to those of dividuation)”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=3&annotation=QSP9LXQR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"b) introducing a perhaps more  surprising comparison between societies of control and Goffman’s (1961)  ethnographic work on total institutions.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=3&annotation=G2IDL7E9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Bringing the two aspects together we will argue  that institutions of control function by sequencing dividuals across institutional  domains in a process of totalization.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=3&annotation=H6YWG48S) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"whereas those looking to revive the communist idea argue that critique is  irretrievably implicated in the sordid game of ‘parliamentarianism’ such that it  should be replaced by a reinvigorated sense of political commitment (for example,  Badiou and Žižek, 2009)”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=4&annotation=SD23AWMJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Deleuze’s essay is split into three sections: ‘History’, ‘Logic’, and ‘Program’, with  the middle section afforded the most space.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=5&annotation=4VNGRQYJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Deleuze adapts an idea from William Burroughs when he labels  the emergent post-disciplinary dispositif; control (Deleuze, 1995, p. 178)”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=5&annotation=9PJUXI92) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The section titled ‘Logic’ has three component parts; it deals first with the  nature of institutions and their relation to each other within societies of control;  it then moves on to a discussion of how this affects individuals at the personal and  collective levels; before ending with a discussion of the machines that correspond  to control (all the while sharpening the contrast between discipline and control).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=5&annotation=VJA8GULW) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In a justly famous distinction, he argues that disciplinary confinement molded individuals according to roles and functions  whereas controls are defined by modulations that traverse both the social field and  the life-course of individuals.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=5&annotation=SHDX54TP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Turning to forms of political subjectivity engendered by control, Deleuze  contrasts the processes of individuation operative within disciplinary institutions  with those processes of dividuation that signal control. ‘We are no longer dealing  with a duality of mass and individual’ he says, rather ‘individuals become dividuals  and masses become samples, data, markets or banks’ (Deleuze, 1995, p. 180).”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=6&annotation=E5KH6UCW) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"How are such processes of dividuation made operative as control? Deleuze  turns to the machines that correspond to this form of society – information  technologies and computers – adding that ‘this technological development is  deeply rooted in a mutation of capitalism’ (Deleuze, 1995, p. 180),”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=7&annotation=QDAK52PR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"‘marketing is now  the instrument of social control’ that ‘produces the arrogant breed who are our  masters’ (Deleuze, 1995, p. 181).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=7&annotation=AHXZHMM9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In relation to the former,  Deleuze returns to the brief examples of how disciplinary institutions are breaking  down and being supplanted by mechanisms of control located in the continual  modulation of dividuals.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=7&annotation=RII74ZTX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Galloway provides a striking case in point: ‘the society  of control is characterized not by the power of the institutions of modernity, or  pre-modernity, the army, the prison, the university, the church, but instead by  what he [Deleuze] called the ultra-rapid forms of free-floating control that are  inherent in distributed networks’ (Galloway, 2006, pp. 318-9).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=8&annotation=EKF9ZA82) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"we suggest  that it remains crucial to understand the transition from discipline to control as a  process in which the institutions are transformed, rather than treating it as the  emergence of a de-institutionalized social formation. The aim is not to criticize  technological accounts of control – in fact, they are becoming especially pertinent  as the everyday lifeworld we inhabit is increasingly governed by computational or  algorithmic logics – but to complement those analyses with an awareness of the  how institutions function in control societies.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=8&annotation=EL7FNVM8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"While it is now widely understood that disciplinary institutions segment  individuals and populations into a series of independent subject positions, control  institutions function by separating the components of individuality in ways that  tend toward the dispersal of these dividuals across the whole social field, often in  conflictual and contradictory ways. The population in control societies is no  longer a mass (of individuals) but a trajectory of dividuation tending toward total  absorption with the technological mechanisms of control.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=9&annotation=IFQPNVJ9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"As Goffman puts it, the ‘central feature of total  institutions can be described as the breakdown of the barriers ordinarily  separating these three spheres of life’ (sleep, play and work) such that ‘all aspects  of life are conducted in the same place and under the same single authority’  (Goffman, 1961, p. 17).”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=10&annotation=CTFZ8UEI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"We may consider the totalizing institutions of control society in terms of the  transformation of the diagrammatic feature of disciplinary institutions instilled  with an awareness of the institutional permeability that comes from Goffman,  minus his optimistic belief in relatively free non-rational logics of civil society but  instead with a nuanced understanding of these disaggregated and increasingly  technical forms of authority. The shift from the designation total to ‘totalizing’  indicates these dynamic institutional features.”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=12&annotation=KYHH666V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"normal role functioning but also a backstage; that area where we can let our social  roles slip and simply ‘be ourselves’. But if, following Foucault and Deleuze, there  is no such civil life that stands in contrast to institutional life nor a backstage that  serves as a normative benchmark for analyses then, in fact, we are having to  occupy several stages all at once, perform several roles all at once, construct  several scenes all at once, in all aspects of our lives, with no backstage as a site of  retreat.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=14&annotation=B9UT2NWP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Where disciplinary institutions operate through the making of subjects,  control societies totalize dividuals without the formation of a subjective centre.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=14&annotation=CXGCVLYA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"computational turn, which despite its pretence to ‘objectivity’, appears  as a turning point away from the ambitions of modern rationality  anchored in empirical experiment and deductive – causal – logic and,  despite its promises of personalization and better taking into  consideration of individual merits, needs, abilities, preferences, does  not address individuals through their reflexive capabilities or through their inscription within collective structures, but merely through their  ‘profiles’ (Rouvroy, 2012, p. 2).”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=15&annotation=JS7XAJCA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"parliamentary-capitalism”</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=17&annotation=ZAGQB6CX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Rouvroy presents a compelling answer: ‘what has to be preserved as  antecedent to both the subject and sociality, as excess of the world over  algorithmic reality, is “the common”, the “in-between”, this space of common  appearance in which we are mutually addressed to each other’ (Rouvroy, 2012, p.  13).”</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=18&annotation=KTDVTBJJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"‘dividual law’; a form of judicial practice that is ‘not based on individuals and their  property but rather on the singularity of manifold ecologies beyond property and  individualization’ (Raunig, 2016, p. 175).”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=19&annotation=UC56TTAL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"what is an algorithm? And how do totalizing institutions  sustain algorithmic functioning?”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=19&annotation=7IGEZYUA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"an algorithm is a process, but importantly it is a finite and contained  process. In this sense, it is correct to talk of algorithms as ‘IF…THEN…functions’,  where IF specifies the conditions of the operations and THEN specifies the  consequences of the operation.”</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=20&annotation=9RAZ5M5T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Thirdly, that which is operated upon can be  referred to as data, information, code and so on but we follow Lazzarato’s (2014)  treatment of these as signs”</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=20&annotation=5BR2SUXJ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"What these clarifications also highlight, however, is a prima facie case to  turn to a process philosophy of signs in order to interrogate what is required of a  critique of control societies, at the level of the algorithm.”</mark> [Page 20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=20&annotation=8NVJ9JTR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"According to Williams, the formal qualities of the sign are threefold: a)  every sign is a selected set (Williams, 2016, p. 6); b) each set has at least one  diagram that expresses the relations in and around the set (Williams, 2016, p. 6);  c) each set is ‘open to many diagrams that are not unique’ such that each sign is  open to revaluation (Williams, 2016, p. 7).”</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=21&annotation=5KYYP62X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"Algorithms, for all of their apparent fluidity and  flow, are ultimately limited to the extent that they must presume particular significations within the sign in order for the bounded function to operate. The  excess of potential expressed by a fully-fledged process philosophy of the sign,  therefore, provides the immanent ground of a critique of algorithmic  governmentality; immanent because it is internal to the logic that sustains the  algorithm itself”</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=21&annotation=C76T9RXQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Indeed, a  similar point is made by Bueno in his work on the attention economy: ‘a critique  of the attention economy cannot remain at the level of the examination of the  cybernetic machines that transform the productive process…but must move  towards the analysis of the power diagram that produces and makes use of these  new technologies’ (Bueno, 2017, p. 135).”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=22&annotation=Q2593KNP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The role of totalizing institutions, therefore, is to  sustain particular distributions, particular and changeable diagrams, of these  sequenced modulations in line with algorithmic functioning. They do this by  sequencing dividuations in the first instance but also by retaining a certain,  apparently open-ended but actually limited (hence totalizing but never total),  series of components which then enables the functioning of the algorithms across  different modulations of totalizing institutions.”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=23&annotation=NPZBK34I) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Having clarified what we understand as the grounds of critique in control  societies, are we any nearer to the political task of deciding between alternative  forms of resistance in order to unravel the snake’s coils?”</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=24&annotation=J7RM6S7V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"For example, for all of Raunig’s sensitivities to the idea that we should  not presume that there are new forms of revolutionary subjectivity simply waiting  in the historical wings, there is still a tendency toward a necessitarian reading of  certain political struggles. He says: ‘the current fields of struggle necessarily  develop from the lines of flight of indigenous, ecological and feminist struggles;  monopolist land ownership, extractivism, strategies of displacement and the  renewed colonization of im/material commons for constituting new modes of  subjectivity that no longer take recourse to the primacy of the individual’ (Raunig,  2016, p. 180).”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=25&annotation=8DPAQ23L) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"While we certainly agree that such struggles offer many insights  into contemporary strategies of resistance, we are more cautious about the idea  that they ‘necessarily’ proffer forms of resistance that take flight from control.”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=25&annotation=NBW9JUH6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"He says; ‘what if we didn’t teach everyone to code but taught everyone the logic  that underlies all such digital systems and gave everyone access to knowledge  about how hardware and infrastructure really work?”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=26&annotation=9CSMRD2G) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"At the interface of the abstract and practical we find the means with which  to challenge the snake’s coils, not by appeal to an ever more fluid algorithm of  movement nor by appeal to a less coiled form of institutional existence, but  through the counter-sequencing of the snake’s segmented movement itself.”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G9ABYD5Z?page=26&annotation=P6XV7NW8)
