> "In Making Constituencies: Rethinking Representation as Political Mobilization Lisa Disch takes on the critiques of contemporary democracy grounded in a pessimistic view of voters' engagement and knowledge and arguments about the limits of political representation. Contemporary work on voting emphasizes the lack of knowledge and time invested in politics by most voters. Voters take their cues for voting from groups with which they feel allegiance for reasons unrelated to their social or political concerns. Citizens, too often subject to manipulation, support candidates who will act against their real interests. We think of our elected representatives as simply supporting the views of voters and interest groups who are responsible for their election instead of actively engaging voters. Disch argues against both views. She contends that voter participation is not as limited as many argue and that representation plays a more active role in organizing and engaging voters. She argues for an idea of representation as mobilization, engaging and involving citizens in causes that do represent their interests and helping to give voters the ideas and information necessary to actively participate in the political system"--
