> [!abstract]-
> abstract:: The present study focuses on the situation in which mind-reading machines will be connected, initially through the incorporation of weak AI, and then in conjunction to strong AI, an aspect that, ongoing, will no longer have a simple medical role, as is the case at present, but one of surveillance and monitoring of individuals—an aspect that is heading us towards a future techno-panoptic singularity. Thus, the general objective of this paper raises the problem of the ontological stability of human nature which, within the limits of the technological singularity of mind-reading machines, leads to the loss of autonomy and a reduction in freedom when it comes to human thoughts. In this paradigm, the hypothesis of a future era of technological singularity is prefigured to be a cumulation of factors in which artificial intelligence holds a dominant position in relation to the human agent, in a techno-panoptic system of human supervision, in the form of a new world order of manifestation/imposition of power—that of a “singleton.” The theoretical objective analyzes the phenomenon of “deterritorrialization” (Deleuze & Guattari, 2000, 2005) of the Foucauldian panoptic mechanism (Foucault, 1995, 2003, 2006, 2008)—which is based on the “biopolitical” system of “biopower”—and its “reterritorialization” in the “territory” of the techno-panoptic singularity, where the scenario of a strong AI “singleton” (Bostrom, 2004, 2006), represents the alienation of the Being into a hard technological determinism.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In overview, this refers to a techno-panoptic surveillance of the individual, through this (strong) AI technology located in the brain—an aspect that makes the AI mind-reading machine no longer a simple external device, but an embedded system. For the beginning, within the limits of a Deleuzian interpretation, this involves the processes of “deterritorialization” of weak AI mind-reading technologies, from its artificial dimension and its “reterritorialization” in the biological structure of the human mind, an aspect that subjects human nature to technology and induces the phenomenon of self-alienation.

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The simulation of safety, security and moral responsibility, induced both at the societal and at the individual level—that such a surveillance system would impose—results from the undermining of the power games that will no longer unfold in the “biopolitical” paradigm of the “biopower” of the human, but in that of a universal technological system of domination and control, of the artificial, in the form of a “singleton” guided by strong AI.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EEWB22TH?page=11&annotation=UB77XIIG)
