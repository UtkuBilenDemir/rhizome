- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"to make representation a distinctively modern concept, by emancipating it from its medieval roots”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=1&annotation=ZE6B3ING) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"and employing it to establish a clear identity for the state as a separate entity in its own right (Skinner 1989, 2002).”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=1&annotation=L4AVI6TT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"But Pitkin also makes it clear that Hobbes’s theory of representation is not a viable theory, because it stands in direct opposition to the”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=1&annotation=WYGIQHF5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"democratic presupposition that individuals may object to what is being done on their behalf by their political representatives.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=2&annotation=WFYLPIKN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For Hobbes, a sovereign representative, once authorized, cannot be constrained, and therefore has absolute power to rule as he sees fit.2 Thus although this may be an “authorization” concept, it is also far too authoritarian by our current standards. So, Pitkin argues, Hobbes is clearly “wrong” about representation, and a different account is needed.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=2&annotation=Z8JHK7FV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"One way in which this might be done is to argue that Hobbes’s own ideas were designed to be more democratic than commentators have sometimes recognized.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=2&annotation=67LCMIH8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Abb ́ e Siey` es”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=3&annotation=3JBB4TRV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Carl Schmitt, whose self-declared “democratic” theory of representation, with its emphasis on plebiscitary leadership and extra-legal forms of political authorization, while echoing Hobbes in a number of respects, hardly rescues Hobbes from the suspicion that he is not a genuine democrat in anything but the most minimal sense of the term (Schmitt 1996).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=3&annotation=TSQY825R) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Hobbes’s influence on Schmitt recapitulates rather than resolves the problem.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=3&annotation=ZNKJXBDB) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The fact that Hobbes allows individuals to disown the actions of their sovereign when faced with death is not enough to make the theory in any sense democratic, since democracy requires not simply that we can disown the actions of our representatives but that we can constrain them in some way.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=5&annotation=HK8K42SX) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For what is striking about the version Hobbes gives in Leviathan is that he does not on the whole use the language of representation to describe the relationship between an individual subject and their sovereign.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=5&annotation=GE9KSHX7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"“Present the Person of them all (that is, to be their Representative)” (ibid.: 121, italics in original)”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=5&annotation=D2IYF2DE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Hobbes is saying that political representation is not the representation of a united multitude”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=6&annotation=5CI3PQLP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"equally, it is not to allow individuals to have more than one representative.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=6&annotation=QNQMQI4G) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Both of these ways of thinking about representation are, in Hobbes’s eyes, inherently unstable.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8YITD4C2?page=6&annotation=6K75ZJ25)
