> abstract:: I'm again reading Deleuze & Guattari's Anti-Oedipus in preparation for our next session of ‘Envelopes’. The book has nothing direct to say about Artificial Intelligence, but I have A.I. on the brain, so it spurred me to write some thoughts and offer them to you. 

Envelopes 3, a discussion of this text's first chapter, should be up in a week or so. 

ENVELOPES is a series of discussions on the intersections of philosophy, creativity, and politics by James Batcho and Jonathan Bennett-Bonilla. Our aim: Rather than explaining a text, we read a text as a means of thinking through what its concepts may offer toward the possibilities of creative expression and transformation.
