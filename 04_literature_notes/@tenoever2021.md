> abstract:: The Internet architecture is widely perceived as engine for innovation by providing the equal opportunity to deploy new protocols and applications. This view reflects an imaginary that guides the co-production of policy and technology that can be traced back to the early days of the Internet, which is still prominent among the engineers in one of the main governance bodies of the Internet, the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF). After the privatization of the Internet architecture in the 1990s, the interplay between the architectural principles of end-to-end, permissionless innovation, and openness subverted equality among Internet users and hampered their ability to redesign the Internet. I draw on media studies, science and technology studies and international political economy, and use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to show how the Internet architecture’s affordance structure got reconfigured, and how this facilitated the prioritization of corporate interests over the interests of end users.

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The IETF has not operationalized any structural assessment of the impacts of their standards and protocols. The lack of integration of impact assessments in the standards process and the intentional undermining of technical standards has led to a discussion about the legitimacy and adequacy of the self-governing technical standards bodies to deliver a trustworthy Internet architecture (Rogers and Eden, 2017).”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QLLZYTL2?page=4&annotation=2WC54XA4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"To be able to connect to the network, every device needs a unique number, an IP address. It was never envisaged that so many devices would be connected to the network, so when more devices were connected, IP addresses were running out and a new addressing scheme needed to be developed. This was especially pressing since adding new nodes to the network is an inherent part of the principles of openness, one of the Internet’s architectural principles. However, there was no direct replacement addressing scheme ready, and there were projections that IP addresses would run out by 1994.18 This led to the introduction of the “temporary solution” of NAT, which allowed a network of computers to share one public IP address (Francis and Egevang, 1994) from the pool of IP addresses. While this was an efficient short-term solution, this directly went against end-to-end principle according to which “packets [should] flow unaltered through the network” (Carpenter, 2000). NATs interrupted the packet flow because the IP address of the end-device is not known to the network or the recipient and needed to be added by the middlebox, thus adding functionality to the network.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QLLZYTL2?page=9&annotation=JSWMDNE7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"When the network grew beyond a group of researchers, there was the need to introduce firewalls “which screens network traffic in some way, blocking traffic it believes to be inappropriate, dangerous, or both” (Freed, 2000: 2). Firewalls were installed on end-devices, home routers, as well as inside larger networks and thus not only found at the edges of the Internet.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QLLZYTL2?page=9&annotation=CNNEYAJD)
