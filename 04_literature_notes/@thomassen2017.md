> abstract:: This article maps debates within poststructuralism, particularly poststructuralist political theory. I argue that the category, or question, of representation can make sense of theoretical and political debates within poststructuralism in general and poststructuralist political theory in particular. Poststructuralists criticise all forms of presence, whether the presence of the subject, identities or structures. Following poststructuralism, representation can no longer be seen as the reflection of a presence. However, while poststructuralists agree on the turn away from presence, they disagree where to turn and, specifically, on the role and nature of representation. They disagree whether representation is constitutive, and they disagree about how to relate to the hierarchy and violence which, they all agree, is a part of representation. The question of representation may not explain all divisions among poststructuralists, but the question of representation divides poststructuralism in so many ways that it makes sense to analyse the differences among them through the lens of representation. I first look at two issues central to poststructuralism: critique and how to relate to ‘the other’. In the second half of the article, I turn to look at three debates within poststructuralism: immanence versus transcendence, abundance versus lack, and autonomy versus hegemony.

	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Poststructuralists do not argue that nothing is present, as if nothing were real and everything were ephemeral; poststructuralism can be materialist, even if it has often been accused of idealism, including by other poststructuralists. Poststructuralists argue that whatever is present – class identities, for instance – is constituted in the terrain of representation. Presence should not be understood as some essence (of a structure, of what it means to be a human being and so on), and representation cannot be understood as the reflection of presence.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=2&annotation=YQVGGILB)

	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"When drawing up a map, one also places oneself in relation to – and within – that map, and any map excludes certain things from view in order to make other things (more) visible. Mapping poststructuralism helps navigate it, but any map is bound to be a contingent and provisional representation of a field because the field – here, poststructuralism – does not exist as an object independent of the representation of it.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=2&annotation=9VG7URK7) 
	 	- This would be a good mathematical definition. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Another example is Lacan (2006) who aimed to show two things at once: (1) that there is no discourse without a Master, and (2) that no discourse of the Master can succeed in fully mastering, or governing, the contingency of discourse and of life. There is no discourse without some Master signifier – a populist leader, for instance, in Ernesto Laclau’s (2005a) use of Lacan – that fixes the meaning of the different parts of the discourse, but something always escapes the fixation of meaning.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=4&annotation=6PREP6ZG) 
	 	- Representation cannot cover the whole extent of the reality? 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The discourse of reason is questioned from a position outside of, but defined by, that discourse, and so the risk is to merely invert the hierarchy between reason and madness. Foucault’s later work on power can be seen as a response to this. There he takes the subject as a subject of representation: subjectivated within discourse, or representation, but not wholly subjected to the discourse and therefore capable of resisting it (Aryal et a, 2016: Part I; Boyne, 1990; Custer, 2016; Williams, 2001: Chapter 5). Foucault (2008) might offer a subtle negotiation of the question of representation, also in his later work on governmentality and the state where resistance could be seen as a practice of negotiating the limits of representational structures.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=4&annotation=24EZSJ9N) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"econd, how can we do justice to the excluded other? Whether justice means including, giving voice to or something altogether different, the excluded other cannot speak through the discourse from which it is excluded.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=5&annotation=THAR9SEQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"In ‘Can the Subaltern Speak?’, Gayatri Spivak (1988; see also Aryal et al., 2016; Boyne, 1990; Custer, 2016) criticised Foucault and Deleuze for trying to circumvent the problem of how to make ‘the other’ speak in a way that was at once impossible and romanticised the other.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=5&annotation=B6CB4B8P) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The problem was, according to Spivak, that Foucault and Deleuze thought it was possible to let the other (the subaltern) speak for themselves, in an immediate way and not mediated by discourse and representation, and so not mediated by power and exclusion. In other words, Foucault and Deleuze return to presence, the presence of the discursively unmediated voice of the subaltern. The subaltern, Spivak argued with Derrida, can only speak as a subject position within a discourse and can only be heard as this or that subjectivated subject.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=5&annotation=A3RYMTCX) 
	 	- It is not just about "if representation" but also "as whom". You are represented, but you are represented as the given role in a specific discourse realm. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The political stakes here concern the way in which a critical and radical discourse can relate to the dominant societal discourses, to those excluded from them, and to the possibility for change. If representation is constitutive, then any critical and radical discourse goes through representation – and institutions – which is another way of saying that there is no critical and radical discourse which is not also involved in inequality, marginalisation, exclusion and power. These are precisely the issues at stake for many of the political movements which emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis. For those movements with their slogan ‘they don’t represent us!’, the question of representation is central and has implications for their political strategy: Should one work through the existing institutions, or should one pursue a strategy of flight from the state and other institutions?”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=5&annotation=XBNYWV76) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"eleuze and Guattari (1994: 46) describe this kind of transcendental in the following way: ‘one seeks to rediscover a transcendence within the heart of immanence itself, as a breach or interruption of its field’. Différance is a kind of transcendence within immanence, but – and this is important – as a ‘breach or interruption’, as something which cannot be contained within the immanent system. The same could be said about Lacan’s notion of lack and Laclau’s notion of antagonism. In Laclau’s (2005a: 244) terms, we are dealing with a failed transcendence – which is really another way of saying a failed immanence.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=6&annotation=PFDJPAFI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"It should be clear, then, that we can make sense of the immanence versus transcendence debate through the lens of representation. What divides philosophies of immanence and transcendence is whether difference can and should be conceived in a way which eschews representation, or whether difference can and should be conceived in relation to, even if only as the interruption of, representation.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=7&annotation=LMMHQUQ7) 
	 	- Immanence and transcendence in representation would be a good title 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Deleuze and include William Connolly and Jane Bennett.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=7&annotation=59FJUSYP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For theorists of lack, representation is constitutive, and they conceive of representation in structuralist terms as a system of differences, even if that system is always marked by contingency, a contingency which can only be understood in relation to representation. However, it is also on this basis that Laclau (2005b: 256–258) seeks to eschew the choice between abundance and lack. While the Lacanian notion of lack is central to his work, the other side of this is excess. But excess here means contingency and heterogeneity, which is to say that it is an excess in relation to a representative structure, and so it is not excess qua abundance.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=7&annotation=6SAK3J6M) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Theorists of abundance are not content with existing pluralism, but pursue an active cultivation of difference – what Connolly calls pluralisation – through agonistic respect. It is a search for ways for society to be open to new ways of life not presently recognised. To stay with the Deleuzean metaphor, they try to extend rhizomatic networks because they believe that this is the best way to cultivate a pluralising attitude towards the excluded other.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=8&annotation=DR2HMMV6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"nspired by Spinoza, Deleuze and Foucault and by the Italian autonomist movement, theorists of autonomy such as Hardt and Negri, but also Paolo Virno, argue that struggles against Empire must be organised as networks of networks.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=8&annotation=YY3EY94D) 
	 	- Potentially paper worthy 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Theorists of hegemony include Laclau and Mouffe, but one may also add Slavoj Žižek and Jodi Dean despite their differences with Laclau and Mouffe. Inspired by Antoni”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=8&annotation=KW9P69JC) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Gramsci, and also by Lacan, they argue that it is necessary to articulate different identities and struggles into what Laclau and Mouffe call a chain of equivalence represented by an empty signifier. This is the way to create a common identity – a common will, in Gramsci’s terms – and the populist articulation of ‘the people’ is the clearest example of this. Through the creation of a common identity, it is possible to build a social and cultural hegemony which will eventually become State.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=9&annotation=R6JBTR5T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"What needs to be challenged is the lack of alternatives offered to citizens, not the very idea of representation…. It is through representation that collective political subjects are created, and they do not exist beforehand (Mouffe, 2013: 125–126).”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=9&annotation=SCP4CUAH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"first, is representation constitutive or not? Second, to what extent does representation silence and/or give voice? Another way to sum up the difference between the two is to say that what divides them is whether we can think of the emergence of a new political subject without representation – that is, is a new subject of the left necessarily a subject of representation?”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GH2XHCK9?page=9&annotation=FZJ4QYJI)
