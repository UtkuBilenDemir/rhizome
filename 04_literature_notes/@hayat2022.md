> abstract:: Sometimes, people engaged in politics actively refuse to speak for anyone but themselves. These unrepresentative claims multiply in social movements in times of crisis. During the French Yellow Vest movement of 2018–2019, such unrepresentative claims were routinely made by Yellow Vest leaders, to the point of being a condition for having a leadership position in the movement. By making these unrepresentative claims, they declined any representative mandate, asserting their freedom from any instituted influence. However, by claiming to speak only for themselves, they also selected the aspects of their identity they performed. This allowed them to embody the people sharing this identity, recalling the medieval
              repraesentatio identitatis
              , but in a way adjusted to today’s greater personalization of politics. Drawing on this movement and on other examples of unrepresentative claims, we can delineate three broad ideal-types of identities that may be put forward by unrepresentative claims: generality, particularity, and individuality.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Saward makes an argument that is both simple and compelling: representation is fundamentally an activity of claim-making in which a maker presents an audience with a relation between a subject and an object—the latter being constructed by selecting elements from an existing referent (Saward 2006, 302).”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=1&annotation=5ALNSRLT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"an idea best captured by the German word Vertretung and, on the other hand, representation as embodiment, identified by the conceptual historian Hasso Hofmann as repraesentatio identitatis (Hofmann 1973), a medieval term used to designate situations in which a representative (often an assembly) could stand for an entity (a universitas, or corporation) without any mandate, simply by speaking as pars pro toto, a part for the whole—better corresponding to the initial meaning of the German word Repräsentation (Hayat, Péneau, and Sintomer 2018).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=EFCWRC7I) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"My hypothesis is that these claims multiply and thrive in historical periods marked by the crisis of representative government and the expansion of popular protest. In these configurations, some social movements develop a rhetoric that rejects all forms of political representation and defends the power of the people.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=LUWE3ZTD) 
	 	- hypothesis is based on the representative crisis in the current liberal democracies. 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"However, there is an important difference, which has been overlooked and is integral to the distinctiveness of these popular movements: unlike in constituent moments, the rejection of representation also affects the potential leaders of these movements, who are in constant danger of being rejected by the protesters if they claim to speak for them.2”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=EV4P38YD) 
	 	- Can it be the only reason maybe? 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"discussing several popular upheavals, asserted that their political claims may have been representative in the aesthetic sense of Darstellung, but not necessarily of Vertretung, delegation, or mandate (de Barros 2020)—only to be strongly criticized by Lasse Thomassen, who in a more radically constructivist vein stated that claims about objects of representation always implicated a subject, thus a form of Vertretung (Thomassen 2021).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=F44NICKL) 
	 	- Once the claim is made, it is not Datstellung anymore, it deploys a reprresentaion already. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"According to the radical version of Saward’s constructivism, political or even social reality is entirely constructed by these claims: the structure of reality is only defined by the contingent success of the claims. In the moderate version, on the contrary, social reality preexists any claim, so the structure of the referent actually matters when it comes to the success or failure of the claims.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=RUP4GPVF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"This should be related with Pierre Bourdieu’s critique of the Marxian conception of social classes: Bourdieu advocated against Marx for a radical constructivism by refuting the idea that classes exist as economic realities before they are represented (Bourdieu 1991b).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=2&annotation=QE2W4IXT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"as the political scientist Christian Le Bart phrases it, “the refusal of verticality challenged all forms of leadership, representation or even simply delegation to a spokesperson” (Le Bart 2020, 99). The anthropologist Serena Boncompagni observed a similar “principle of horizontality” on the roundabouts she studied: “Yellow Vests were busy questioning—almost systematically—the propensity of some to organize and represent others,” making it “extremely dangerous for all who risked taking on responsibilities, particularly that of spokespersonship” (Boncompagni 2021).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=3&annotation=YA8JZ9Z8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"discuss with representatives of the movement4 and, more importantly, against the possible Yellow Vest leaders who would accept. They stated that We do not want “representatives” who would end up talking for us! (...) If we appoint “representatives” and “spokespersons”, it will eventually make us passive. Worse: we will quickly reproduce the system and act from top down like the scoundrels who rule us. These so-called “representatives of the people” who are filling their pockets, who make laws that rot our lives and serve the interests of the ultra-rich! Let’s not get ensnared in representation and political maneuvering. This is not the time to hand over our voice to a handful of people, even if they seem honest. They must listen to all of us or to no one! (...)We will not let ourselves be ruled. We will not let ourselves be divided and bought off. No to self-proclaimed representatives and spokespersons! Let’s take back the power over our lives! Long live the yellow vests in their diversity! LONG LIVE THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE!5”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=4&annotation=MAJHUZUT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"They called themselves “official communicators” (communicants officiels), a term that had never been used in a French social movement until then, and insisted they were “not leaders or decisionmakers, but messengers.”10 After two of them, Drouet and Ludosky, met the Minister of Ecology, they refused any further negotiation, insisting that all future encounters with officials should be broadcasted live, and the group was dissolved.11 As Eric Drouet then explained, “there can be no representative for the movement, it is the whole of the Gilets Jaunes that must speak.”12 Other occurrences may be found in the discourse of all prominent figures of the movement. They did not even try to use the legitimization provided by charisma, as they often pretended to be figures just by chance, easily replaceable by any other activist.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=4&annotation=48ZNQUSE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Yellow Vest leaders who managed to remain in charge—as if it was a necessity to make an unrepresentative claim to remain a representative of the Yellow Vests.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=4&annotation=LQCW3FR2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"A similar move had been made in Turkey during the Gezi protests: the government invited a group of personalities, including TV stars, to represent the protests and then later a group of activists. As Zeynep Tufekci comments, “by not choosing its own leaders and representatives, the Gezi movement yielded power to the government, allowing it to usurp the choice of negotiators” (Tufekci 2017, 72).”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=4&annotation=EZGHXHJ2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"When someone claims to speak only for herself, she makes a negative representative claim, stating that she, as a subject, does not stand for anyone else.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=5&annotation=CRWM5MJR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"In the constructivist perspective developed by John Searle, “institutional facts” are created through the attribution of “status functions” to persons or objects that acquire “deontic powers” through “declarations” (speech acts) that are collectively accepted (Searle 2011).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=5&annotation=3ZGYZGQM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Expanding on Searle’s framework, the pragmatist sociologist Luc Boltanski states that “an institution is a bodiless being to which is delegated the task of stating the whatness of what is” (Boltanski 2011, 74)—that is, to maintain the integrity of social reality. The problem is that in order to exist, as bodiless beings, institutions have to be embodied by spokespersons authorized to make declarations on their behalf.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=5&annotation=4L3MS3I2) 
	 	- An empty signifier to be filled in by any any claims by its organs. 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"we have to take into account the opposite suspicion, overlooked by Boltanski, that is born from the hermeneutic contradiction: that behind every living person that speaks in the social world, there may be an institution acting. In Searle’s account, there are good reasons to dismiss these cases as impossible, as institutions precisely rely on collective recognition. But once you introduce the suspicion that persons speaking for institutions actually speak for themselves, you may consider the reverse possibility, that some institutions act through people who speak for them without claiming that they do.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=5&annotation=UKTQ56QI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"we do not know what lies behind the speech of other humans and we often have to make inquiries about them to stabilize our conception of social reality—a situation linked by Boltanski with the general destabilization of societies by capitalism since the end of the nineteenth century, which led to the emergence of detective novels, sociology, conspiracy theories, and clinical paranoia (Boltanski 2014).14”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=5&annotation=AD7GHQWU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Thomassen 2021”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=STSHSV5J) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"But there is a consensus about the fact that such claims imply representation in the sense that as performative claims, they necessarily participate in the construction, in the mind of audiences, of representations of the object of their claim—here, the very self of the claim-maker. As Mónica Brito Vieira puts it, despite “Occupy’s self-depiction as a post-representational movement,” protesters had to “remain inscribed in a representative paradigm”showing the “inescapability of representation” (Brito Vieira 2015, 504–6).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=LEC9JXZ9) 
	 	- denying representation becomes the form of representation. 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"As Linda Alcoff explained in her seminal article about speaking for others, “in speaking for myself, I am also representing myself in a certain way, as occupying a specific subject-position, having certain characteristics and not others, and so on. In speaking for myself, I (momentarily) create my self—just as much as when I speak for others I create their selves—in the sense that I create a public, discursive self” (Alcoff 1991, 10).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=A2SRVQ22) 
	 	- once you speak, you are not representing only yourself 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"even when I deny that I am speaking for someone else, I speak as someone, thus making a portrayal (my self, the object) of the referent of my claim—that is, myself, the person that makes the claim.18”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=UUHKXZ9J) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"“when x represents y as z, y signifies the referent, and z signifies the kind of representation it is” (Fossen 2019, 828)—that is, the object of the representative claim.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=BRQMAS4A) 
	 	- The essence of referent 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"hen I make an unrepresentative claim, I picture myself (the referent, the person that speaks) as my self (the object, the portrayal my claim makes): neither the referent nor the object is absent. We can now see why unrepresentative claims do not fit well in”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=YWRZYQ7M) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"the standard model based on Pitkin’s core meaning of representation as “making present in some sense of something which is nevertheless not present literally or in fact” (Pitkin 1972,8–9).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=V4ABELTR) 
	 	- Like Thomassen argues through post-struct., the presence is no more. But me as an object and referent present. 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"onstructivist authors have focused their critique on Pitkin’s idea that this absent entity should preexist representation—what Iris Marion Young, following Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida, called the “metaphysics of presence” (Young 2000, 126).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=LZNB6QM9) 
	 	- Look up! 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"According to constructivists, on the contrary, representative claims are performances that construct both the represented and the representative (Disch 2012; 2021; Disch, Sande, and Urbinati 2019; Fossen 2019; Rezende de Almeida 2018).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=4D32P8SF) 
	 	- However, the self is also not a filled signifier. By claiming, I represent myself, I'm defining the self as well. 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"However, unrepresentative claims present a specific challenge to this definition by showing that it is possible to have a representation in the sense of portrayal without any absent entity, whether it is considered preexisting or not. When I claim to speak only for myself, to paraphrase Pitkin and underline the inadequacy of her definition for assessing for unrepresentative claims, I make present in some sense the self which is present literally.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=9KIPIKNK) 
	 	- Yes but saying I'm representing myself isn't a reference to my existing self, first I need to construct it. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"ocial interactions may be conceived as theatrical performances in which participants try to influence the mental representations (Vorstellungen) others have of them by making representations of themselves (Darstellungen).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=7&annotation=V24M2PBA) 
	 	- Vorstellung braucht eine Darstellung zuerst. 
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">"they also may help construct an image of authenticity and genuineness.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=8&annotation=H3NZ57N8) 
	 	- That is a good part of the self they are creating. 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Yet, starting with examples from the Yellow Vest movement, we can establish three ideal-types of objects constructed by unrepresentative claims by distinguishing between three broad categories of identities that may be underlined by a subject making them, without implying a mandate: generality, particularity, and individuality.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=8&annotation=5ISFPS6X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In the position of expertise claimed by Ludosky or the experts participating in the ISO 26000 committees, the only legitimacy of their word is that they are experts: they have to claim that they themselves have no stake to hold, no interest to defend, in short that they are not representatives of anything but themselves—in their capacity as experts, be they citizens or scientists. A related situation emerges every time a professional is defined by the generality of the interest or principle she defends, which prevents her from making any other representative claim but gives her a “legitimacy of impartiality” (Rosanvallon 2011).23”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=9&annotation=HUSJYQGZ) 
	 	- generality 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Jérôme Rodrigues who became a prominent figure after he lost an eye to a rubber bullet. With his large beard and his eyepatch, he became a symbol of the Yellow Vests, represented in numerous drawings shared in Facebook groups or sometimes drawn on Vests. The mutilation of his body, combined with the fact that he continued to demonstrate and appear in the media, allowed him to embody the selflessness of the movement. So at the most abstract level, unrepresentative claims may reinforce someone’s claim to speak as someone guided purely by the principle she may embody: science (experts), the cause (martyrs), a discourse (Dryzek and Niemeyer’s discursive representatives; Dryzek and Niemeyer 2008), or the general interest (Rousseau’s Legislator”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=9&annotation=F3R5HN89) 
	 	- best establishment of generality is to die for them? 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"They claim to be just simple Yellow Vests with no other characteristic, as though they had been selected at random, which enables them to embody the whole movement without any mandate.25 Such unrepresentative claims are quite common among activists, not only Yellow Vests.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=9&annotation=QFE5UBIT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"“We do not ‘speak for’ the poor and oppressed around the world, but we are in solidarity with them.”26 Most certainly, there is a representative claim at work when constituting the “We” of the Occupy movement, and the “We are the 99%” should be understood as a proper representative claim.”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=10&annotation=IKXUK3M9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In his work on the way the media represented the Yellow Vests, Christian Le Bart showed how journalists and Yellow Vests converged in selecting figures who had no history of activism but could be presented as “mere individuals snatched away from their everyday life by their legitimate anger, [thus] having the grandeur of authenticity” (Le Bart 2020, 39).”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=10&annotation=YYLZARSH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"To demonstrate this authenticity, journalists multiplied individual portraits, “gaining in consistency and substance what they lost in representativeness” (Le Bart 2020, 55). Although they refused to represent the Yellow Vests in the usual sense of political representation, these figures represented them from an aesthetic point of view, as past characters do in historical narratives (Ankersmit 2001; 2002)”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H64TBXIT?page=10&annotation=RU8KVMF6)
