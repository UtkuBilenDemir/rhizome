# Sanderson, Brandon - The Way of Kings

## Highlights and notes

- Today, that included wearing white. Loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope, and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves, open at the front.

White to give warning. For if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you coming.
