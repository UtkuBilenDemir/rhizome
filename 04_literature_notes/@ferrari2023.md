- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Capital and labour are only two of a plethora of codes that mediate how people interact with one another and how they conduct their daily lives. In rendering intelligible the role of the media in the second half of the twentieth century through the lens of hyperreality, Baudrillard identified a ‚Äòprecedence of simulation over all that already existed as real‚Äô (Hegarty 2004, 60). To summarise Baudrillard‚Äôs claims, we are unable to distinguish reality from a simulation because simulations are omnipresent features of reality itself. This argument remains indispensable in an era of AI-generated media. But in the 1990s, Baudrillard could not have foreseen the rise of deep generative models as algorithmic driving forces of synthetic media production.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=4&annotation=Y7S28E8C) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Surely, there is a reliance on inputs of real-world training data (Offert 2021). But beyond that algorithmic grounding in reality, deep generative models are also rooted in a specific political-economic reality.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=4&annotation=K3KN7CLE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The cultural perception that today‚Äôs AI-generated media might be a little too real is certainly part of the structures of feeling associated with the post-digital. From this perspective, we are living in an already post-digital world defined by decades of laborious world-building through materialising computer modelling and computational imagination. This evolution might be characterised with what Hayles (1999:, 8) defines as reflexivity: ‚Äòthe movement whereby that which has been used to generate a system is made, through a changed perspective, to become part of the system it generates.‚Äô The very possibility of synthetic media representing productive force in the first place indicates a particular conjecture in post-digital societies (Berry and Dieter 2015).‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=6&annotation=AZPQTKRA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"‚Äòindustrial metaverse‚Äô (Lange 2022) is not a proposal to re-write reality, but rather a discursive attempt to push more production into a rentier relationship with proprietary reality engines. What is at the stake here is not the dissolution of reality and simulation in a philosophical sense but the intensification of rentier relations across cultural life.‚Äù</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=17&annotation=CDVNSZSZ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"OpenAI‚Äôs large-scale language model GPT-3, which the company offers on a subscription basis to users, similar to how cloud providers provide access to their computational resources. Although it remains to be seen whether and how GPT-3 or DALL-E will find their way into the daily business of media organisations, mapping this emerging ecosystem of services is an auspicious task.‚Äù</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=17&annotation=EWZBLAXM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In this article, we discussed a certain facet of this development: the role of video game engines. The juxtaposition of autonomous vehicles and virtual influencers showed that although game engines are used in very different ways, two factors of asset specificity can be clearly identified: real-time physics and 3D graphics, and programmability and modularity.‚Äù</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=17&annotation=5QKZX8GY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"First, we agree with Steinhoff (2022) in that it is pivotal to go beyond regulatory agendas that are purely derived from privacy-oriented concepts8, like Zuboff‚Äôs (2019) influential notion of surveillance capitalism. At its core, Zuboff‚Äôs argument relies on the key premise that the extraction, accumulation, and analysis of real-world user data is the most important competitive advantage for technology companies.‚Äù</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI6IITW9?page=18&annotation=AB6XUUCR)
