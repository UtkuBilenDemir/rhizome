- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"which would supply ‚Äúan internal model of how the world works‚Äù so that AI becomes ‚Äúconfigurable‚Äù to each new situation it encounters (2022: 2‚Äì3). The powerful claim that a flexible, reconfigurable world model could deal with all potential future unencountered situations defines much of the politics of contemporary generative AI.‚Äù</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=&annotation=6DUK23G9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"ways of perceiving, characterising, classifying, and knowing the world. In sum, we consider generative AI to embody a series of mutations in computational ways of knowing, and these mutations are reconfiguring political models of the world.‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=2&annotation=CDUZV28E) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"they give shape to the governing rationality of generative AI and lend conceptual substance to the actually existing technical systems through which a world model is built.‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=2&annotation=QBGKM5G2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"To illustrate the logic of estimating an underlying distribution it is helpful to think of a contrasting logic.‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=UIR8IR2T) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"a generative model estimates an underlying joint probability distribution from which the training inputs are conceived as having been sampled.‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=KVXXI67Q) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In the dual context of a political desire to leverage unlabelled data on populations and a computational drive for efficient scaling and novel inference, the generative model offers a distinctive new logic of distribution.‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=DDKCRV7S) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Generative techniques have their own political logic of distribution, distinct from the Aristotelian notions of distributive justice ‚Äì who is entitled to what, or what a fair distribution would be ‚Äì which preoccupied political theorists in the late twentieth century (Rawls, 1971; Walzer, 1983), and different from the ‚Äúdistribution of the sensible‚Äù that decides what or who can be perceived (Rancie`re, 2010, p. 36). The politics of distribution in generative AI stem from a different tradition, that of probability. This sense does have precedent in political thought, notably in the ways that statistical populations became the objects of government in the modern period (Foucault, 2007, pp. 108‚Äì9).‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=WQ3QSKWE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"What changes when we think less in the pragmatic terms of direct data-label relationships and more in the metaphysical terms implied by generative modelling: of approximating some type of underlying joint distribution behind the phenomenal world of appearances?‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=LJZ7VS6N) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"syntactical relationships‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=WD7DDWSE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"a desired behaviour‚Äù</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=3&annotation=2DBZEWF9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The politics of distributions in this generative sense differs from the important but now familiar criticism that models merely reflect or ‚Äúparrot‚Äù the data on which they were trained (Bender et al., 2021). These models produce an ambiguous politics, in which the speculative ‚Äì the probabilistic sampling of novel outputs ‚Äì is generated and inferred from an assumed empirical ‚Äì the heterogeneous data foundation on which these models are trained (Campolo &amp; Schwerzmann, 2023). The political logic of the underlying distribution governs a world via the traversing of a data foundation so that decisions and courses of action will be immanent to the structure of the underlying distribution.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=4&annotation=D4TWANV7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The promise of large language models is that predicting the next token in a sequence affords a capacity beyond the sequence itself: an understanding of the whole structure of the underlying text: ‚ÄúNext character prediction, next something prediction, has the special property that it discovers some hidden structure in the data‚Äù.‚Äù</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=5&annotation=WRG9NZ5V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The attention mechanism signals a key moment in a long history of forms of attention in the world, where ‚Äúthe problem of attention becomes a fundamental issue‚Äù within the human sciences and the governing of populations (Crary, 2001, p. 13; see Pedersen, Albris &amp; Seaver, 2021).‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=3AGG3ARM) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The transformer architecture likewise has inescapable political implications as a means of dividing, partitioning, attending to, and acting upon the world (Ranci`ere, 2007; Foucault, 1991).‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=S257G5AT) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"structuring a model of the world where multiple potential non-linear causal links, or ‚Äúglobal dependencies between input and output‚Äù can be drawn (Vaswani et al., 2017, p. 2).‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=MPIDIEJE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"and so relationships will be surfaced from across a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù or long-range picture of the underlying data structure. As a political logic, the global dependency structures attentiveness to relationships that might otherwise be overlooked.‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=SRSMUW7E) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"We wrote the rules for chess and the rules for Go, but we‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=FRZDWCSV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"did not write the rules for biology, so in a sense we have moved to radical empiricism‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=GVIHVTK5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The transformer model he is using in the lab is precisely drawing global dependencies between the input and output on vast human genome datasets, so that the model is structuring attention to relationships that are not formulated in advance as axiom, rule, or hypothesis. The machine learning sense of ‚Äúattention‚Äù being ‚Äúall you need‚Äù begins to install itself as a broader political logic, marked by an active alignment between non-linear and parallelized computation, the combining of vast public and private datasets, and the non-linear and simultaneous problems that are apparently to be addressed by LLMs.‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=JQTLB9M2) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"If the political order of generative AI is one in which sequences are broken and de-linearized in favour of scattered, non-linear global dependencies, how might we describe the types of objectives and tasks addressed by these machine learning systems, and their orientation to action in the world?‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=AEV3T79V) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"We opened this essay with a discussion of LeCun‚Äôs appeal to the ‚Äúworld model‚Äù as a flexible and adaptable model capable of acting upon any new entity not encountered in the training data. Contrary to LeCun‚Äôs sense that generative AI does not have a model of the world, for us the political logics of generative models are precisely instituting a governing logic that actively builds a kind of transformer worldview.‚Äù</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=6&annotation=H284J67B) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Zero shot learning opens onto a horizon of a generalised and domain agnostic exploration of potentials. The initial pre-training and finetuning paradigm altered the models‚Äô relationship between the universal and the particular, the general and the specific. Models such as BERT used a universal or general-purpose LLM trained on a large corpus, and then fine-tuned it on a new set of literature for the particular task domain.‚Äù</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=7&annotation=BEIBXRC6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"you‚Äôre exploring the multiverse of fictional possibilities, sculpting the space of those possibilities‚Äù‚Äù</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=7&annotation=TFS548NP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">". The transformer breakthrough with ‚Äúattention is all you need‚Äù parallelizes these sequences so that non-linear or distant dependencies can be made to matter. It is a speculative and predictive political order that promises to govern non-linear problems by attending to the ‚Äúglobal dependencies‚Äù in all available unlabelled data. Finally, with the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, the desire for ‚Äúzero shot‚Äù learning (classifying the previously unencountered) becomes simultaneously desired as a zero-shot politics of responding to all unencountered events. With the rise of the prompt, the generative model offers itself as an open-ended and experimental mode of governing, with each prompt seeking to elicit desired behaviours from model and from the world.‚Äù</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=8&annotation=2PFHG3VF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"where the claim to an underlying distribution must contain the possibility of multiple other distributions, or points on the distribution that were discarded alternatives.‚Äù</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YV4QK2ZG?page=8&annotation=P34UNLI3)
