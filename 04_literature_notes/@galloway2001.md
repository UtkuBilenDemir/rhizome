- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"It means that we must also descend into the somewhat immaterial technology of modern-day computing, and examine the formal qualities of the machines that constitute the factory loom and industrial Colossus of our age.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=3&annotation=ACLGKW3D) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The factory was modernity’s site of production. The “non-place” of Empire refuses such an easy localization. For Empire, we must descend instead into the distributed networks, the programming languages, the computer protocols, and other digital technologies that have transformed twenty-first-century production into a vital mass of immaterial flows and instantaneoustransactions.”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=3&annotation=XHIGDKC3) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"the former having yet to achieve recognition as a “natural language””</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=3&annotation=EYMIGIDI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"These conventional rules that govern the set of possible behavior patterns within a heterogeneous network are what computer scientists call protocol. Protocol is voluntary regulation within a contingent environment.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=4&annotation=IDS3EFIH) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Hardt and Negri confirm this position by writing elsewhere that “the passage to the society of control does not in any way mean the end of discipline. In fact, the immanent exercise of discipline … is extended even more generally in the society of control” (330)”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=4&annotation=TKKKCXES) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In order to initiate communication, the two nodes must speak the same language.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=7&annotation=LZF346I7) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"symptoms of passage”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=7&annotation=QV662NDL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"This new enemy not only is resistant to the old weapons but actually thrives on them, and thus joins its would-be antagonists in applying them to the fullest. Long live difference! Down with essentialist binaries”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=7&annotation=RQI77FF4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"ll fall under the category of biopolitics. Further, he writes that biopolitics “tends to treat the ‘population’ as a mass of living and coexisting beings who present particular biologicaland pathologicaltraits and who thus come under specific knowledge and technologies” (71). Biopolitics, then, connects to a certain statistical knowledge about populations. It is a species-knowledge.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=8&annotation=KNRBJZGI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Foucault’s treatment of biopower is entirely protocological. Protocol is to control societies as the panopticon is to disciplinary societies.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSTAMP7Z?page=8&annotation=95HZHQUJ)
