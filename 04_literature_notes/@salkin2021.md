	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Call this audience uptake. Audience uptake occurs when an audience‚Äîan individual or a group‚Äîtakes a person or group to speak or act on behalf of another person or group.‚Äù</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=2&annotation=J77HNLGV) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Many of an IPR‚Äôs duties emerge by virtue of their power to influence audiences, not by virtue of choices that that IPR may have made to gain that power. Willingness plays no role in constituting a party as an IPR, but does make a difference to what duties that party thereby acquires. Voluntarist accounts conflate what makes it the case that a party is an IPR with what makes it the case that an IPR has duties by virtue of being so positioned.‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=4&annotation=EZA5KB2X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"formal political representatives (FPRs)‚Äù</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=4&annotation=X4X9D6P9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"As noted, we may call the fact that makes it the case that someone is a representative under conditions of informality audience uptake.‚Äù</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=5&annotation=6ZN42TU8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Subject matter. Informal political representation may emerge in forums that are not inherently political.27 Imagine you and some friends are around the dinner table. None of your friends is religious, but you are. The conversation turns to the practice of prayer.‚Äù</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=5&annotation=Y5JREDGN) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"First, authorization in formal and informal contexts is markedly different. The FPR speaks or acts for a group by virtue of a systematized election or appointment scheme. The procedure tends to be stable and well established. IPRs may also be authorized, after a fashion, if they come to receive support or endorsement from most or all of those for whom they are taken to speak (call this group uptake, a type of audience uptake). But informal authorization will be fundamentally different from formal authorization, and, more importantly, authorization is not a precondition for emerging as an IPR.32‚Äù</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=7&annotation=5LSUVIAP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Just as authorization looks markedly different in formal and informal contexts, so too does accountability.33 Formal contexts often have organized and, in theory, reliable methods for holding representatives accountable. For instance, an FPR may be subject to impeachment, recall, or just good old-fashioned voting out. In informal cases, what accountability mechanisms there may be‚Äîfor instance, protest, disavowal, or dissent‚Äîwill be more varied and less reliable.34‚Äù</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=7&annotation=WAMFD8WK) 
	 	- How do you communicate the diapproval to the IPRs for real. 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"udience uptake obtains: Ascription. An audience ascribes a speaker‚Äôs or actor‚Äôs statements or actions to a group or its members. Credibility conferral. An audience regards a speaker or actor as a credible source of information about a group or its members. Testimonial reliance. An audience relies on a speaker‚Äôs testimony when attempting to understand what a group‚Äôs members want, value, or prefer. Invitation. An audience invites a speaker or actor to stand in for a group or its members when the group‚Äôs members‚Äô interests are at stake in a given forum.‚Äù</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=8&annotation=37GIQN7B) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"A news anchor pulls you aside to ask how your neighbors are holding up during the emergency curfew imposed after a tornado damaged your town‚Äôs water system.38 you emerge as an IPR for your neighbors at that time. In other cases, uptake may not happen all at once. Imagine you are a scholar who has for years conducted longitudinal studies and in-depth interviews on the impact of tornado damage on the lives of people in that same neighborhood.‚Äù</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=9&annotation=SCMKDXR8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"udience uptake may even elude the very audience that brings it about. That you take someone to speak or act for others does not mean that you realize you do. I discuss unwitting audiences in Section V.‚Äù</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=10&annotation=FCXFMN2J) 
	 	- There is also a constructivist uptake like the alt-right spokepersons do. 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The point here is a conceptual one: it is possible to create conditions that make audience uptake more likely without thereby oneself performing uptake.47 Distinguishing audience uptake from creating conditions that make uptake more likely helps us understand the place and importance of self-appointment within a complete theory of informal political representation. That a party makes a selfappointing claim (‚ÄúI am the emissary of ... the entire Jewish People,‚Äù48 say) may explain why uptake obtains in a case.‚Äù</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=11&annotation=7DWNLC74) 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"audience attempts uptake in an epistemically mistaken way, then the uptake is faulty. Faulty uptake, you may think, does not confer representative status.‚Äù</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UJ7C7MJZ?page=12&annotation=6LC4LCNI)
