> abstract:: Deleuze's Postscript on the Societies of Control has been the most common entry point for interrogating the ways in which contemporary digital technologies have altered the social and the subjective from a Deleuzo-Guattarian perspective. It is, however, in A Thousand Plateaus that we find the most comprehensive set of resources for grappling with the Algocene, the contemporary digitally interconnected world of ubiquitous computing, drones, data mining, smart cities, social media, automated trading and other data-driven technologies that are heavily reliant upon algorithmic processes and deep learning networks. In this broad survey, I argue that in order to grapple with these new technological assemblages and the implications of their deployment across society, we should posit a new major stratum, the algoplastic, and, along with it, new modes of operation of order-words and the regimes of signs they form part of. I conclude by posing some of the new problems that emerge with the Algocene.

In order to make use of an ANN, a method called ‚Äòforward propagation‚Äô is applied.

Feeding one picture of a cat to an ANN (the best known of which are, at time of writing, deep convolutional networks) will not produce any results, though.

Essentially, backpropagation simply informs an ANN about incorrect results so that it can modify its weightings. Training complete, the ANN is then set to work and, presented with new pictures of cats that were not in the training data, should be able to recognise them with a high degree of accuracy.

GANs consist of a pair of ANNs that train each other through recursive normalisation of inputs and outputs. Instead of a human researcher intervening to adjust weightings (supervising), the GAN system pits two ANNs against each other: one functions as the ‚Äògenerator‚Äô or trainer, creating false positives which it provides to the second ANN, the ‚Äòdiscriminator‚Äô or learner, along with true positives. Simply put, the generator attempts to trick the discriminator, which learns from its mistakes while the generator simultaneously learns how to trick the discriminator better. In other words, there is an iterative feedback loop that results in the optimal fitness of both ANNs.‚Äù</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/63WFAXQF?page=8&annotation=6SND9PJ2)

	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"it is in fact human cognition that becomes the deep learning network, continuously adapting itself and modelling behaviour in response to inputs from artificially intelligent systems of algorithmic governance (for a closer examination of deep learning from the perspective of faciality, see Celis Bueno 2020). On this view, algorithmic reason subjectivates through the deployment of the underlying abstract diagrams produced by technical systems of adaptive artificial learning ‚Äì most saliently what are known as generative adversarial networks ‚Äì across the whole of society. Could this be the illusion constituting algorithmic Man?‚Äù</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/63WFAXQF?page=11&annotation=555PUFQS) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Dan McQuillan describes this illusion as a form of ‚Äòmachinic Neoplatonism‚Äô (2018). As he argues, the models learnt by ANNs ‚Äòare taken as revealing something significant about the world. They take on the neoplatonism of the mathematical sciences; a belief in a layer of reality which can be best perceived mathematically‚Äô (McQuillan 2019).‚Äù</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/63WFAXQF?page=12&annotation=7YRWY4DU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"‚Ä¶ data science does not affect by argument alone but acts directly in the world as a form of algorithmic force. It is machinic, that is, an assembly of flows and logic that enrolls humans and technology in a larger, purposeful structure ‚Ä¶ as computation becomes pervasive, capturing and reorganising human activity, data science exerts its philosophy directly as orderings, decisions and outcomes.

	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"incorporeal transformations of individuals with a constant transformation of dividuals or larval selves, and a simultaneously obscuring of the new set of relations that takes hold between subjects of enunciation and subjects of the statement. The consequences of these new algoplastic dynamisms of subjectivation distributed across the various layers of The Stack call for a rigorous political engagement with the possibilities of the present and The Stack-to-come (Bratton 2015: 293‚Äì349), but a cautiously experimental one too, given that, as Deleuze and Guattari remind us in Anti-Oedipus, when it comes to the Algocene we have not seen anything yet (Deleuze and Guattari [1972] 1977: 240).‚Äù</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/63WFAXQF?page=16&annotation=6MJPZJKN)
