            A key feature of federal systems is the representation of subnational units by “territorial representatives” in policymaking at the federal level. How do such arrangements influence the linkage between public opinion and policy outputs? I argue that policymaking under territorial representation should be systematically skewed toward opinion in those states where citizens care about a policy issue and have a uniform view on it. This claim is tested using a novel data set of policy change in the European Union (EU), covering 211 policy issues and 6,506 observations of opinion–policy dyads. Results show that measures weighting opinion across member states by how much national citizens care about an issue are better predictors of policy change than EU‐wide mean opinion. Moreover, congruence between state‐level opinion and EU‐level policy becomes more likely, the more salient and clear‐cut opinion in a member state is. These findings refine our understanding of the opinion–policy linkage under territorial representation.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"aid little attention to the effects of federalism and territorial representation more broadly. If anything, scholars have argued that federalism may weaken the opinion–policy linkage since it obscures the clarity of responsibility for voters (John, Bevan, and Jennings 2011; Wlezien and Soroka 2012).”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=&annotation=ZHN3LH48) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"I test these claims with a novel data set from European Union (EU) politics containing information on cross-national public support for policy change as well as the EU’s adoption record for 211 policy issues on the EU’s agenda between 2004 and 2011. Methodologically, the data set builds upon “best practices” from studies of policy representation in the United States (e.g., Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012). The EU case is a suitable case to test whether territorial representation matters for the opinion–policy linkage, as opinion and salience vary across member states, interregional logrolls are standard practice, and territorial dynamics are facilitated by a weakly integrated party system (Hix 2002; Hix and Lord 1997; Hix, Noury, and Roland 2007).”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=2&annotation=SCPSH3ET) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Inversely, the analysis of over 6,000 dyads of EUlevel policies and related opinion in each of the member states shows that congruence between state-level opinion and EU-level policy becomes more likely the more salient and clear-cut state-level opinion is.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=2&annotation=Y65N5H8K) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"0). However, the existing studies hardly address the question of how territorial representation affects the opinionpolicy linkage. To be clear, by territorial representation, I refer to the representation of subnational units or states in political decision making at the federal level by regionally, (in)directly elected “territorial representatives.””</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=2&annotation=D75YJRAG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"What happens under territorial representation? A standard example for territorial representation is a twochamber legislature in a federal system, where representatives in the second chamber are elected in various districts, often territorially identical to subnational units/states (e.g., the U.S. Senate, the Swiss Council of States).”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=3&annotation=T5JF53QL) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The more dispersed opinion and salience across territories and the more disproportional the power of representatives to constituencies’ voter populations, the stronger the consequences of territorial representation for the opinion–policy linkage should be.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=4&annotation=BRYGD9XA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"H1(Responsiveness): The greater the salience-weighted support for policy change across member states, the higher the likelihood of EU-level policy change. H2(Congruence): The greater the national opinion majority on an issue and the more salient an issue is to the national public, the higher the likelihood of congruence between statelevel opinion and EU-level policy change.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=5&annotation=TT6FKX6S) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"To test these expectations, I collected an original data set of public opinion and policy change in EU politics. The data cover 211 concrete policy issues that occurred on the EU’s legislative or constitutional agenda after the bloc’s Eastern enlargement to 25 members in May 2004 and before the end of 2011. To my knowledge, this is the first data set on policy representation in EU politics. The new data and the data collection approach, which closely replicates approaches used in prominent U.S. studies (e.g., Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012), are described in detail in Section 2 in the supporting information.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=5&annotation=5TE2ESUD) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The key adoption variable is binary, with 0 indicating the status quo prevailed and 1 denoting policy change. Policy change occurred in 36% of the cases and after a median time lag of 1,191 days.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=6&annotation=4B4L4WME) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"the salience of a policy issue for the public is measured through the share of “don’t know” (DK) and refusal responses (of all responses). As Page and Shapiro (1983, 181) put it: “When the proportion of don’t knows is relatively low—that is, when more people are willing to offer a preference—it is a sign of more public interest and attention and perhaps also stronger, more intensely held opinions.””</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=6&annotation=PP3NKCHR) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"∑I  i=1 Saliencei,j ∗Opinioni,j  ∑I  i=1 Saliencei,j  . The salience  weights Saliencei, j are the fractions of DK responses rescaled between 0 (minimum salience across all observations) and 1 (maximum salience across all observations).6”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=7&annotation=N4MJZ88M) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"∑I  i=1( Saliencei,j + Poweri )∗Opinioni,j  ∑I  i=1( Saliencei,j+ Poweri ) . I call this the “Council:  unequal power” specification. Second, since the EP and the Commission have been found to be most powerful if the Council decides by QMV (Franchino and Mariotto 2012), I assign the midpoint between the salienceweighted opinion measure and EU-wide mean opinion to all issues potentially decided under majority voting.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=7&annotation=TAIDD7ET) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"We are interested in whether these specifications of the territorial model explain policy change in the EU. The main confounder for identifying their effect is EU-wide mean opinion (e.g., across the EU-25/27 population).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=7&annotation=AVLFKKQF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"log-likelihoods from the two models indicates whether one model fits the data significantly better.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=8&annotation=BSBP5CNG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Compared to alternative tests of its sort, the Clarke test is more likely to select the correct model in situations with small samples, high canonical correlation of the models, and leptokurtic distributions of the log-likelihood differences (Clarke 2007).”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=8&annotation=H83ZGCQ6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"tor for model comparison. The Bayesian approach allows us to make statements about the relative posterior probability of competing models. Such a statement about odds is attractive compared to the Clarke test, which simply tests a null hypothesis of both models fitting the data equally well. Assuming two models are equally probable a priori, which appears appropriate in our case, the posterior odds of two competing models Mj and Mk, Pr(Mj |data)  Pr(Mk |data) ,  are equal to the Bayes factor, which is defined as the ratio of the models’ marginal likelihoods. To derive Bayes factors, I reestimate frequentist logistic regression models of policy change in a Bayesian setting using a random-walk Metropolis algorithm.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=8&annotation=WVBLIMJ9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"To illustrate the substantive magnitude of responsiveness, I use the logistic regression estimates from the “Council: equal power” specification (using the full sample) and plot the effect of salience-weighted opinion on the predicted probabilities of policy change in Figure 1. This reveals a strong status quo bias of EU policymaking. Even if there is a solid majority of 60% salience-weighted support for policy change, the probability of change is only 27%. Nevertheless, it substantially rises with opinion up to 60% probability of change if support for change is 90%.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CJURF2K6?page=9&annotation=F9F36D2L)
