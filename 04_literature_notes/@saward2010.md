- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"First of all, let us look at what exactly is going on when representative claims are made. What is in this claim? It begins with the familiar idea that in representation an individual or a collective stands for, speaks for, or acts for, another. In other words, a subject stands for an object — an elected MP for a constituency, for example. But we need to look more widely than this. Some individual or collective agent constructs or makes the claim — a &quot;maker.&quot; And the thing represented is an idea of it, not the thing itself, which is better called a &quot;referent&quot; (if the politician makes himself the &quot;subject&quot; who stands for an &quot;object,&quot; the object is his idea of his constituency — &quot;good, hard-working folk&quot; for example — rather than the referent, which is all the other things the constituency is, or might be). All of this needs, and has, an &quot;audience,&quot; which receives the claims and accepts, rejects, or ignores them. Therefore, there are different ingredients to a representative claim: maker—subject—object—referentaudience (see Box 2.1). Representation is an ongoing process of making and receiving, accepting and rejecting claims — in, between, and outside electoral cycles.”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=6&annotation=3VL3I724)

	 	- Saward's operationalisation 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"It is crucial to note — and as I hope to demonstrate, entirely right — that the representative claim (and therefore political representation), expressed in this abstract form, can cover a wide diversity of cases. Taking some familiar binary distinctions, in principle it covers formal and informal, electoral and non-electoral, and democratic and undemocratic claims (amongst others — I consider in detail in Chapter 3 key lines of variation of representative claims). To get a sense of this definition&#39;s wide applicability, it is helpful to consider briefly some basic examples of representative claims fitting this schema: 1. The MP (maker) offers himself or herself (subject) as the embodiment of constituency interests (object) to that constituency (audience). The referent is the actual, flesh-and-blood people of the constituency. The object involves a selective portrayal of constituency interests. 2. The Liberal Party (maker) offers itself (subject) as standing for the interests of the &quot;family&quot; (object) to the electorate (audience). 3. Marx (maker) offered the working class (subject) as the symbol of revolutionary hope (object) to the would-be members of that class (audience). 4. Antiglobalization demonstrators (makers) set up themselves and their movements (subjects) as representatives of the oppressed and marginalized (object) to Western governments (audience).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=7&annotation=BF4NSH2J)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"being elected does not take away the need to make symbolic claims, it merely establishes a particular frame within which the claims are made (a frame that often has a serious impact on the plausibility of the claim, as we see in Chapter 6 in particular).”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=7&annotation=HIC9MAKQ)

	 	- More examples 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Consider, for instance, one common equation: legitimate representation requires formal authorization by others (see Figure 2.1).4 The common binary distinctions set out in Figure 2.1 would rule out of consideration — and perhaps by a process of naturalized stipulation, effectively rule out of existence — types A and D. They would be ruled out because if conceptually we cannot look for them, we may not see them (or, if we do, we may downgrade unduly their relevance). This effect, in turn, stands to reduce the richness of political representation.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=11&annotation=8YIGN6YA)

	- <mark class="hltr-red">"it is never quite clear where or how invocations of representation might gain some purchase. Where for the presence approach some X stands for some Y, for the event approach there is a claim that some X, by virtue of some alleged capacity or attribute, can speak for Y, to Y, and a wider audience. The presence approach tends to posit a given subject, where the event approach posits an invoked or summoned subjectivity. The presence approach tends to lead to a view of representation as practiced within a settled set of institutional domains (elective ones in particular), while the event approach is more open to an unsettling of what may be regarded as domains or spaces where representation occurs.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=13&annotation=CPKACF7K)

	 	- Hen egg problem 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The representative claim, then, consists at the most general level of five key, interconnecting dimensions: maker, subject, object, referent, and audience. Each is crucial, or so I argue, to a robust, detailed, and illuminating account of the world of representative politics. It is unusual to bring together all of these dimensions in accounts of representation; this set encapsulates an effort to bring together certain themes in the history of the idea that have for a long time been held separate (as noted in the Introduction). I now briefly draw out their key attributes and connections.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=15&annotation=NPNT7SF5)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"46 Mapping the representative claim institutions (including electoral institutions).8 Subjects (or signifiers) and objects (or signifieds) are not just &quot;out there,&quot; in a certain number and of a certain type. There are &quot;makers&quot; — spin doctors are a clear enough political example but there are many more — of claims about them, claims that generate and energize specific senses of subject and object (and which generate and focus upon specific would-be &quot;audiences&quot;).”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=16&annotation=QIQFN293) 
	 	- Subjects are signifiers and the objects are signifieds 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"United Kingdom at the 2005 general election, Michael Howard, and his advisers, made representative claims depicting the British people as deeply concerned by the issue of immigration (or something else, since dogwhistle politics lay at the heart of this campaign), but the claim was not substantially borne out in the actual vote (a large part of the audience did not buy the claim at the heart of the performance). Makers of representative claims could be makers of bad, or unacceptable, or unaccepted claims; they could also be makers of compelling, resonant claims about themselves and the would-be constituents. Nor are the makers of representative claims magicians. They cannot simply conjure claims out of the air (or if they do they are highly unlikely to succeed). Representative claims that are compelling, or which resonate among relevant audiences, will be made from &quot;ready-mades,&quot; existing terms and understandings that the would-be audience at a given time will recognize. The style, timing, and content of a representative claim must tap into familiar, or at least recognizable or emergent, contextual frameworks. Claims must invoke the recognizable as well as (indeed, in order to) create something new; must iterate features of political culture to cross a threshold of potential acceptability.9 I explore this point further by considering the cultural aspects of representation below.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=16&annotation=59J3VIGB) 
	 	- Good example and an even better explanation  to how the makers produce representation/representative claims 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I have suggested, contra Pitkin, that representation in politics is at least a two-way street: the represented play a role in choosing or accepting representatives, and representatives &quot;choose&quot; their constituents in the sense of portraying them or framing them in particular, contestable ways.11 If I allege that you, a potential constituent of mine, possess key characteristic X, and if I can get you to accept this characterization, I can then present myself as a subject possessing capacity or attribute Y that enables me to represent you by virtue of a certain resonance between X and Y . In other words, would-be political representatives, in this process of portrayal or representation of constituencies, make claims about themselves as subjects and their constituents as objects, and indeed about the links between the two; they argue or imply that this subject that you see and hear is the best representative of the constituency so understood.12 Political figures (and their scriptwriters and spin doctors and party supporters, etc.) are in this sense creative actors. They may well be &quot;agents,&quot; as representatives are conventionally understood, but equally or more importantly they are &quot;actors,&quot; makers of claims.1”</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=17&annotation=6RYK3QBZ)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Constituencies, like communities, have to be &quot;imagined,&quot; in Benedict Anderson&#39;s sense (Anderson 1991). The equivalent of Klee&#39;s painting is required in order to make it imaginable, to make it visible, normally both to the would-be members of that constituency and to a wider potential audience.&quot;”</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=21&annotation=6WU9QW6X)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The intended audience of a representative claim may or may not be conscious of itself as an audience prior to the making of claims. We have seen how representative claims are invariably, to one degree or another, constitutive claims; they construct in some measure the groups that they purport to address (audience), along with the groups that they purport to speak for or about (constituency). Claim-makers, of course, do not generally want to reveal this fact; they prefer to be seen to be addressing preexisting, natural or fundamental interests that are already &quot;out there.&quot;”</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3BNDM88G?page=24&annotation=ZRRM5Z6V)
