> abstract:: Abstract: “Democratic responsiveness” occurs when the democratic process induces the government to form and implement policies that the citizens want. The linkages that connect citizens’ preferences, electoral choices, selecting policymakers and policymaking can be subverted at each stage. There are also serious conceptual difficulties created by the complexity of citizen preferences and by uncontrollable factors that shape policy outcomes. The subversions include control over information, incoherence of party policy discourse, unrepresentative election outcomes, officials switching parties after elections, use of executive decrees, bait and switch campaign tactics, and corruption in policymaking. I offer some suggestions about the measurement of democratic responsiveness.

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"L  et me begin by defining terms. For present purposes, “democracy” is identified by the institutional features of universal adult suffrage, free and competitive elections to choose policy makers, multiple information sources, multiple political parties, and civil and political rights. “Democratic responsiveness” is what occurs when the democratic process induces the government to form and implement policies that the citizens want. When the process induces such policies consistently, we consider democracy to be of higher quality. Indeed, responsiveness in this sense is one of the justifications for democracy itself.1”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7SWNC2SF?page=2&annotation=CSS8ZALJ)

	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Institutional Aggregation. Various institutional arrangements are susceptible to somewhat different subversions. In majoritarian systems (whether parliamentary or presidential), where political power is normally concentrated in a strong government chosen via a single-stage election, the subversive force is often a mathematical distortion of the vote-to-outcome relationship.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7SWNC2SF?page=9&annotation=IQYMAZP8) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"An active and independent mass media, educated citizens, and parties wedded to national-scale discourse promote an informed public whose preferences are sufficiently coherent to make responsiveness meaningful. While we do not know much about how such a responsiveness-friendly political landscape takes shape, it seems plain that party competition is part of the picture. So are electoral rules that do not encourage competitive party decentralization and localism. Fairly low barriers to the entry of new parties should help to keep the party system attentive to what citizens want. At the same time, a relatively stable voting pattern (not in itself a circumstance friendly to new parties) can play a role in enhancing citizens’ grasp of the available alternatives and ability to coordinate their electoral choices.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7SWNC2SF?page=11&annotation=N5EE3DIK) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The ideal study of democratic responsiveness would trace the full causal chain outlined in our figure, from citizen preferences through elections and policy-maker selection to policy making, using measures that are comparable across countries. At the moment, the lack of appropriate units for comparing preferences in a commensurate fashion across societies is a serious obstacle, especially given the diversity of needs and preferences in different countries. The best cross-national approximations have thus far appeared for the developed democracies, especially those of Western Europe, where the availability of a generally accepted left-right discourse has greatly facilitated comparison. An initial effort at comparative responsiveness anal”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7SWNC2SF?page=12&annotation=I6YLIV6Z)
