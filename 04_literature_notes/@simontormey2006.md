- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The experiment is being conducted by the Zapatistas, a group that insists that it is ‘exercising power’ not on behalf of the people of the Chiapas, the region it ‘liberated’ from the federal government in 1994, but with the people of the Chiapas.”</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=1&annotation=K6YR5R7Q) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"or for thinking about how the world might otherwise look (the ‘normative political theory’ dilemma). Assuming this to be the case, then what is curious is the degree to which political theory is still evidently wedded to the model of representation as a means for thinking about how communities can function or organise themselves. Rather than witnessing an emerging literature on ‘post-representation’, we see merely the remodelling of representation in ever more baroque fashion so that groups, minorities or diverse interests can be integrated into existing representative systems of governance.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=2&annotation=XE8DP5PQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Like Plato’s Pharmakon, representation has become both poison and cure, both a source of disaffection and the means for its overcoming. In my view this represents a failure of the normative imagination, an unwillingness to contemplate life ‘after’ representation.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=2&annotation=EH7KMYN6) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"As we noted above, the representative function was deployed quite explicitly as a means of filling the hole of political authority created by the waning of temporal and religious authority. This in turn led to the problematic of early liberal thought: the state exists, how can it be legitimated? For liberals (and indeed non-liberals) the answer was to create a unified aggregate, The People, which could then be represented by those who govern.18 On a Deleuzo–Guattarian reading the figure of The People is, however, a ‘passive aggregate’ or ‘denumerable set’ like ‘the majority’, ‘the nation’ or ‘the young’. This is to say they are collective categories deployed rhetorically to justify actions without reference to the actual views of those who ‘compose’ the ‘it’ in question. ‘What The People want’, is not what people want, but rather what it is that someone thinks the people want. It is what the ‘representatives’ of The People’s interests want.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=7&annotation=N9TV4KVA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Deleuze’s work on difference—is not then anarchy tout court, as if we could reach out in the manner of a Godwin, Proudhon or Kropotkin to some ideal state of affairs to supplant the rotten present. As Deleuze and Guattari make clear in A Thousand a t U n i v e r s i t y o f M i c h i g a n o n J u n e 1 8 , 2 0 1 5 h t t p : / / p a . o x f o r d j o u r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d f r o”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=8&annotation=X3NXWWUF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"146 Parliamentary Affairs Plateaus, the key question in moving ‘beyond’ representation is not ‘anarchy versus organisation’.22 Rather, it is supplanting practices that are concerned with articulating what ‘the majority’, whether actual or imagined, want or need. It is concerned with the dissolution of the ‘problematic’ of ‘minorities’ faced with ‘majorities’, of idiosyncrasy confronted by ‘the norm”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=9&annotation=RXWUG982) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The experience of the Zapatistas shows that it is possible to think the ‘outside’ or beyond of representational politics, even when in their own practices and philosophy representational issues remain to be ‘resolved’.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=15&annotation=PNVX7QBS) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"What the Zapatista experiment ‘represents’ is nonetheless a kind of politics that is resolutely ‘immanent’ in the sense used by Deleuze. They are attempting to make autonomy a lived experience as opposed to a transcendent, virtual or cosmetic idea of self or collective empowerment.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZA4F9AV?page=16&annotation=XN8A6XQW)
