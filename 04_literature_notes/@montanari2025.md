            The aim of this article is, on the one hand, to take up and discuss some key categories and concepts in semiotics, in an attempt to analyze the mechanisms underlying current artificial intelligence (AI) models, with a focus on ChatGPT. Although many of these concepts are already being debated, they remain crucial in relation to semiotic and sociosemiotic categories. Concepts such as generativity, perception, textuality, and the effects of meaning, as well as the notion of language itself, require a new semiotic evaluation, including in relation to a cultural history of AI, and the metaphors associated with it. In addition, this article aims to propose more of a general observation and review of some theoretical problems and sociosemiotic issues related to the advent of AIs with some correlated examples, such as in the field of political communication and conflict.

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"ChatGPT is nothing more than a.  clumsy statistical machine for recognizing patterns that ingests hundreds of terabytes of data and extrapolates the most plausible response for a conversation or the most likely one for a scientific question. In contrast, … the human mind is an astonishingly efficient and elegant system that operates with a limited amount of information. It does not seek to infer brute correlations from data but rather to create explanations … Let’s stop presenting it as “Artificial Intelligence” and call it what it is: “plagiarism software.” (Chomsky 2023a)”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=5&annotation=5TTLU5P4) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For Chomsky, this represents not only an ethical breach but also an attempt by systems like ChatGPT to position themselves as “impostors,” claiming equivalence with human intelligence. More broadly, Chomsky raises deeper “techno-moral” concerns. He critiques the creation of engineered intelligences that, while highly efficient, sophisticated, and powerful, fundamentally lack the essential traits of human intelligence: a “moral faculty,” ethical sensibilities, self-control, and the capacity for self-assessment. This absence, he argues, underscores the inherent limitations and potential dangers of relying on such systems.5”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=6&annotation=NTUB4BVQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"From this shifting paradigm, general-purpose AI emerged, especially during a period of strong, optimistic economic growth. On the contrary, 1970s and 1980s saw the development of expert systems – with their databases and inferential machines capable of carrying out acts of querying those databases – but these models encountered significant challenges during what some have called the “AI winter.” However, this period of “stasis” ultimately paved the way for the development of the large language models we encounter today. As Russell observes, these models are marked by their “massive sample complexity,” which allows them to process vast amounts of data, but they also exhibit a “relatively low expressive capacity,” reflecting limitations in their ability to generate nuanced and contextually rich outputs.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=8&annotation=STIMH9FU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"These processes effectively simulate internal “spaces” of connection, mapping relationships between concepts, words, syllables, punctuation, or sentences, which are transformed into “tokens.” In this framework, vectors are employed to measure the distances between these tokens, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships. Crucially, statistics play a central role in these models, enabling the calculation of probabilities for these distances and guiding the predictive capabilities of AI systems. This combination of spatialization and probabilistic modeling lies at the heart of the generative and analytical power of modern AI systems, marking a significant evolution in the ways meaning and structure are computationally processed. Statistics has played here a fundamental role in the analysis, manipulation, and extraction of meaningful information from vectors in AI applications. Various statistical methods are used in vector operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations allow for the manipulation and transformation of data represented by vectors. Statistical concepts like mean, variance, and covariance describe vector properties in vector spaces, helping to understand distributions and relationships within vectors. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) reduce the dimensionality of vectors while preserving essential information, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. Clustering and classification methods, like k-means clustering8 and support vector machines,9 use vectors to group similar data”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=10&annotation=WD54KA3C) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"points or classify them into categories based on statistical principles, leading to accurate predictions. Additionally, feature selection techniques identify the most informative features in vectors, improving AI model efficiency and accuracy. Statistical regression techniques model relationships between input and output variables, commonly used in predictive modeling tasks. Furthermore, distance metrics such as Euclidean distance, or cosine similarity, and others, measure vector similarity or dissimilarity.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=11&annotation=P987TGMY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-purple">"(see Resnik 2024 on this “renaissance” of distributionalism, thanks to statistics and vectorialization).”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=11&annotation=NQ46MLZG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The other key role, alongside statistics and vectorization procedures, has been that played by distributionalism, which has taken on new life thanks to them (see Resnik 2024 on this “renaissance” of distributionalism, thanks to statistics and vectorialization). Distributionalism resuscitated thanks to statistics in AI, which focuses on meaning representation through language distribution models, underpins this framework. The distributional hypothesis, central to this paradigm, suggests that words appearing in similar contexts and patterns tend to have similar meanings. Distributional semantic models, based on this hypothesis, represent word or phrase meanings through their distribution patterns in text corpora. These models often use word embedding techniques like Word2Vec10 and GloVe11 to capture semantic relationships between words.”</mark> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=11&annotation=WXQIBVWQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"1) Statistical language models may have engineering success, but this is irrelevant to science. Accurate modeling of linguistic facts is akin to “butterfly collecting”; what matters in science is the underlying principles. 2) Statistical models are incomprehensible and provide no insight. 3) Statistical models might simulate some phenomena accurately, but they do so in the wrong way. People do not decide on the third word of a sentence by consulting a probability table based on previous words. Instead, they map from an internal semantic form to a syntactic tree-structure, which is then linearized into words, without using probability or statistics. 4) Statistical models have been proven incapable of learning language, suggesting that language must be innate. So, why are statistical modelers wasting their time on the wrong enterprise? (Norvig 2017)”</mark> [Page 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=12&annotation=VF5ZHYAU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-green">"How, then, can we reconcile, on the one hand, the undeniable advancements in research on Large Language Models (LLMs) – advancements driven by the advent of probabilistic-statistical and vector-based models that have successfully moved beyond the stagnation of earlier computational linguistics and the limitations of old distributionalism, as well as countering Chomskyan critiques – and, on the other hand, the criticisms originating with Dreyfus and the notion of a potential computational phenomenology (as discussed by Beckmann et al. 2023)?”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=13&annotation=PY9JPXNU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"“Deep” and “surface” are spatial scientific metaphors relating to the axis of verticality, designating the starting position and end point of a chain of transformations.”</mark> [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=14&annotation=9VAZ83AU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"In any case, Hardik Shah (2023) identifies four types of AI hallucinations:”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=15&annotation=DHRWN76Q) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"More generally, even these issues highlight the need for careful monitoring and ethical considerations in AI development and application, nevertheless, several other AI researchers point out that hallucinations also represent opportunities for experimentation (cf., Thiollet 2024); to observe the emergence of new unexpected patterns and new forms of possible creative meaning in AIs: “hallucinations as sources of Creativity.” At the same time, some scholars suggest that there is here the typical risk of anthropomorphism: that is, of attributing to machines behavior that is excessively similar to that of humans. The problem lies perhaps in maintaining the dimension of experimentation, and at the same time that “right distance” of observation so as not to fall into this kind of fallacy.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=16&annotation=UDT2YGYA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Applying this framework, the AI-generated phenomenon of hallucination might be reframed as a disruption that contributes to semantic innovation rather than as a mere failure.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=16&annotation=VSSKDLXC) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Additionally, this concept of hallucination could be enriched by engaging with definitions from phenomenology. Merleau-Ponty (1945), for example, describes hallucination as the disintegration of reality before our eyes, substituting it with a “quasi-reality.” According to Merleau-Ponty, the world is not a static object with purely objective determinations; instead, it has “splits and gaps” through which subjectivity asserts itself. This interplay of subjective intrusion and ruptured reality might offer a productive lens through which to consider AI hallucinations, framing them as a site of tension between programmed objectivity and the unpredictable emergence of meaning.”</mark> [Page 16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=16&annotation=7NR6E929) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"“machinic chaining” and social subjection”</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=17&annotation=UBX723SG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Beyond warfare, the broader implications of AI raise critical questions about reality and truth in the digital age, particularly concerning simulation and simulacra. The work of Deleuze and Guattari, particularly their concepts of “machinic chaining” and social subjection, provides valuable frameworks for understanding the mechanisms of power and influence embedded within AI-driven communication. These theoretical perspectives shed light on the complex dynamics of enunciation and control that characterize AI’s role in shaping societal narratives.”</mark> [Page 17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=17&annotation=K5MFRN6J) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"meta-narratives: how public discourse today frames and conveys the themes, figures, and metaphors of the technological and social revolution brought about by artificial intelligences. On one side, we observe a range of actors and symbolic representations: the fear of an “other,” an alien presence that is simultaneously close and familiar, juxtaposed with AI systems being cast as saviors – omnipotent or omniscient entities. Here, an unsettling paradox begins to emerge. These very systems, becoming increasingly autonomous, may soon engage in self-representation across the web, media, and public discourse. This raises intriguing possibilities about how AI might influence its own narrative in the collective imagination.”</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=18&annotation=DSLUYX2U) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Consider the case of Transformer models, which exemplify the interplay between metaphor and function. Transformers, a specialized type of neural network, simulate certain structures and functions of the human brain, excelling at processing sequential data such as words in a sentence or notes in a melody. The transformative innovation within Transformers is the “attention mechanism,” which enables the model to focus selectively on the most relevant parts of the input sequence. This mechanism is pivotal for discerning complex relationships and dependencies within data. By revolutionizing natural language processing (NLP), Transformers have driven significant advancements in AI applications. The term “head” in Transformers, for instance, refers to the multi-head attention mechanism, a key feature that captures diverse aspects of an input sequence simultaneously. This dual role of technical objects – functionally specific and mythically resonant – reveals their broader cultural impact. Technical metaphors, often catachrestic and hybridized, solidify not only the utility but also the mystique and credibility of AI systems.”</mark> [Page 18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=18&annotation=GQAG9B26) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"construct an internal image of themselves to achieve cognition and a nascent form of “self-awareness.” Spinoza’s question, famously echoed by Deleuze, “What can a body do?” resonates here. Today, the body remains both a simulacrum and a frontier something to be reimagined and reconquered.”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BPMRCIDX?page=22&annotation=X6SEE454)
