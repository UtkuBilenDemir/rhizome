- <mark class="hltr-gray">"two thousand survey questions on proposed policy changes between 1981 and 2002”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=&annotation=XMVKJDLF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"My data set consists of 1,935 survey questions asked of national samples of the U.S. population between 1981 and 2002. Each survey question asks whether respondents support or oppose some proposed change in U.S. government policy: raising the minimum wage, sending U.S. troops to Haiti, requiring employers to provide health insurance, allowing gays to serve in the military, and so on.”</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=4&annotation=JWY8DZSZ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The data for this project were collected from the iPOLL database maintained by the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut, from the Public Opinion Poll Question database maintained by the Odum Institute at the University of North Carolina, and for time periods where these databases lack sufficient numbers of appropriate questions with demographic breakdowns, from raw survey data supplied by a variety of sources.1”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=5&annotation=Y56YTKXA) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"In all cases, questions were identified using keyword searches for oppose in the question text or response categories and then hand-sifting through the results to find appropriate questions.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=5&annotation=4DUX6R2A) 
	 	- Manual picks 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Because the surveys employed were conducted by different organizations at different points in time the demographic categories are frequently inconsistent.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=5&annotation=HRNNQMGG) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"For each survey, respondents in each income category were assigned an income score equal to the percentile midpoint for their income group based on the income distribution from their survey. For example, if on a given survey 10 percent of the respondents fell into the bottom income category and 30 percent fell into the second category, those in the bottom group would be assigned a score of .05, and the second group, a score of .25 (the midpoint between .10 and .40, the bottom and top percentiles for the second group).”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=6&annotation=XRID76LJ) 
	 	- Hmm? 
	- <mark class="hltr-red">"After rescoring income for each survey, predicted preferences for specific income percentiles were estimated using a quadratic function. That is, for each survey question, income and income squared (measured in percentiles) were used as predictors of policy preference for that question (resulting in 1,781 separate regressions, each with two predictors and an n equal to the number of income categories for that question). The coefficients from these analyses were then used to impute policy preferences for respondents at the desired percentiles. In the final stage of the analysis, the imputed preferences for respondents at a given income percentile were used as predictors of the policy outcomes across the available survey questions (that is, separate regressions for each desired income percentile, each with one predictor and an n of 1,781). This approach has the double advantage of allowing comparisons across survey questions with different raw income categories and smoothing out some of the noise inherent in estimating preferences for population subgroups with limited numbers of respondents.3”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=6&annotation=RXGLXH7R) 
	 	- ? 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Consequently, if the majority of population group X prefers policy change less often than population group Y, group X will ceteris paribus have higher consistency scores. But influence over policy outcomes is reflected in the degree to which policy change is more or less likely to occur depending on whether or not members of that group support it.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=7&annotation=8U774K86) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"To assess the strength of the relationship between policy preferences and policy outcomes across groups, I use measures of association (logistic regression coefficients) rather than raw consistency scores. Regression coefficients (and the associated probabilities of policy change that I report) overcome both of these shortcomings with consistency scores—they incorporate the degree of support (or opposition) to a specific policy proposal, and they reflect the extent to which different levels of policy support are associated with different probabilities of policy implementation within each group.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8VFPFNCK?page=7&annotation=WTTDZHQL)
