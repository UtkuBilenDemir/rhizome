- <mark class="hltr-gray">"The public’s preference for ‘more’ or ‘less’ policy – its relative preference, R – represents the difference between the public’s preferred level of policy (P*) and policy (P) itself:  Rt 1⁄4 Pt Pt:”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=5&annotation=MGKYT6FB) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In practice, the theoretical equation cannot be directly estimated. Most importantly, we typically do not observe P*. Survey organisations rarely ask people how much policy they want. Instead, these organisations usually ask about relative preferences – whether we are spending ‘too little’, whether spending should ‘be increased’ or whether we should ‘do more’.4 This, presumably, is how people think about most policies. (Imagine being asked about your own preferred level of health or education spending.)”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=5&annotation=89WV7BS9) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"W designates the instruments for the public’s preferred level of policy (P*).”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=5&annotation=YJSDB8R5) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"That is, the public adjusts its preferences in response to spending, other things being equal: when spending increases, relative preferences decrease; when spending decreases, relative preferences increase.”</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=5&annotation=QT8HVLCF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Now if there is representation, policy change (DPt) will be a function of relative preferences for policy (Rt71), which reflect support for policy change. Other things also matter for policy, of course, including the partisan control of government (Gt71). Note that both R and G are lagged so as to reflect preferences and party control when budgetary policy, the focus of our empirical analysis, is made.6 For any particular domain, then, the equation is:  DPt 1⁄4 r þ g1Rt 1 þ g2Gt 1 þ mt; ð3Þ  where r and mt represent the intercept and the error term, respectively. This equation captures both indirect and direct representation. The former representation through election results and subsequent government partisanship – is captured by g2, and the latter – adjustments to policy reflecting shifts in preferences – is captured by g1. Other variables can be added to the model, of course.7”</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=6&annotation=ZD2I66LU) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Government Institutions  We have suggested in previous work that the division of powers – both vertical and horizontal – structures the relationships between opinion and policy over time. First, the vertical division of powers, or decentralisation, makes it more difficult for the public to gauge and react to government policy change, and thus dampens public responsiveness. Second, the horizontal division of powers, as in ‘Madisonian’ presidential systems, makes governments more responsive to changes in public opinion. Let us briefly trace the reasoning.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=7&annotation=65WA4CEF) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Federalism, the vertical division of powers, increases the number of different governments making policy and thus makes less clear what any particular level of ‘government’ is doing (see e.g. Downs 1999). Put differently, the government policy signal may be confused – i.e. there may be different signals from multiple sources. This can dampen public responsiveness.”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=7&annotation=5S48LGTE) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The most fundamental challenge is the ‘confusion’ it creates.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=8&annotation=BMMFEJVB) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"We expect that a high level of federalism makes it harder for citizens to assign responsibility for policy, to know what any one level of government is doing.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=8&annotation=KV44QZWI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Scholars have long noted the dominance of cabinets over parliaments (see e.g. the classic statements by Bagehot 1867 and Jennings 1959; also see Cox 1987; Laver and Shepsle 1996; Tsebelis 2002). These scholars portray a world in which cabinet governments exercise substantial discretion, where the cabinet is the proposer – it puts legislation to the Commons – and the legislature ultimately has only a limited check on what the government does.”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=8&annotation=D5H6WXGY) 
	- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Madisonian presidential systems”</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=8&annotation=HHLCSEGP) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Presidents are advantaged in some presidential systems, after all, and here we would expect opinion to be a less significant predictor of policy change. Likewise, the executive has less discretion in some parliamentary systems, and there we would expect a more reliable connection between public preferences and policy change. These possibilities can be settled empirically”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=9&annotation=4WXCVU4Z) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"He distinguishes between ‘consensual’ democracies – characterised by, most notably, proportional representation, multiparty systems and coalition governments – and ‘majoritarian’ systems characterised by simple plurality election rules, a two-party system and single-party government (exactly as Duverger (1951) would predict). Most importantly, Lijphart suggests that consensual democracies provide better descriptive representation and general policy congruence than do majoritarian systems.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=9&annotation=A8HRUK2Y) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Recent research challenges Powell’s findings. Blais and Bodet (2006) argue that, while proportional systems do encourage coalition governments, thus pulling the government more to the centre, they also encourage a greater number and diversity of parties in the first place, which promotes representation of more extreme positions.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=9&annotation=UY9Q7GTQ) 
	- <mark class="hltr-gray">"Here we test our three conjectures relating to political institutions. The measure of relative public preferences – the variable R in the equations above – is critical. For this, we rely on the International Social Survey Program ‘Role of Government I–IV cumulative file’, combining results from the four years in which the survey has included a battery of questions on government policies, namely, 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2006.14”</mark> [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=10&annotation=69MH4XTI) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"Figure 1 displays the simple bivariate relationship between policy change and opinion change in the 15 countries for which we have data between 1996 and 2006.”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=13&annotation=RSE4PZBK) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Now, we have explicit hypotheses about differences across countries. We expect that public responsiveness to policy change varies with the level of fiscal federalism.”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=15&annotation=P9AEGN3X) 
	- <mark class="hltr-orange">"The greater (lesser) the decentralisation of policymaking authority, the lesser (greater) the responsiveness. This is easy to test following equation”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=15&annotation=R6DBUESK) 
	- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The first column shows the model without lagged preferences. Here we see that the spending still has a negative direct impact on preferences, but it is much larger and more reliable. We also see that it has an interactive effect with federalism. This effect is positive. In other words, as federalism increases, the thermostatic influence of spending declines”</mark> [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VKSMADC?page=15&annotation=4UR3YCHX)
