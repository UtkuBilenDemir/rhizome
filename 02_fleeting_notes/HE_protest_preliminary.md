## Motivation & Concept
> other definitions stress the role of SI in building workable ‘utopias’. For Gilles Deleuze, for example, SI takes place through windows of opportunity for social creativity along the lines of life, lines of imagination, and lines of bringing in assets for a better future. all these are windows of opportunity for social creativity which may emerge from challenges to institutional practices. Innovation often emerges from conflict: opportunity spaces at micro scales may make creative strategies possible at macro scales. here, we already see the announcement of the very important relationship between the initiatives of individuals and groups in small communities, and its logic of continuation in the construction and facilitation of institutions that could enable socially creative strategies at macro/micro scales.

-- Moulaert et al

- As Moulaert further argues, SI is always concerned with the human condition and directed against social exclusion. Therefore, one cannot separate SI from its socio-political context (see ibid. 17 )
- In the same manner, researching SI establishes a democratic participation format in itself. Building transdisciplinary research is already a democratic action to improve the human condition.
- The roots of the protest culture started transdisciplinary with worker/student solidarity. 
- SI is not a tool to save or solve the global crisis of the welfare state nor it is the saviour of the liberal democratic cycle. 

> This is why it is so important to focus on the role of SI in developing alternative socio-political discourses and on its potential for social change in particular contexts. In any case, SI as a principle, as a slogan.

-- ibid. 18

**What are the exclusionary and alienating dynamics of the economic system against which SI is reacting? What dynamics feed into the improvement of the human condition? What are social or political movements of relevance for social change? What socio-political dynamics and institutional transformations are needed to make SI a success in the streets, the local communities, and the enterprises?**

> We believe that the concept is best understood and mobilized in the context of a sociological heritage that challenges conventional economic approaches to development, and that has at its heart a desire for emancipatory macro-social change. new directions in SI analysis, a field of expanding diversity, are set within this general framing, which we see as the basis for building a more comprehensive metatheoretical framework that can host the many partial theories, methodologies and practices that characterize and enrich SI.

> whether social innovation should be seen as a contained potential within a hostile overarching socio-economic environment or a political Trojan horse that can be universally transgressive when social and political conditions allow wider mobilisation.

-- hillier

> Gilles Deleuze’s empiricist philosophy, however, offers a view of associationism, which could be useful. In his work with Fe ́ Felix Guattari (1987), Deleuze seeks immanent, micrological conditions of interactive transformation capable of resisting appropriation by major power structures. Deleuze and Guattari ‘look for immanent modes of association in pragmatic assemblages that are capable of inventing alternative forms of social interaction’

We are not trying to identify organic intellectuals but we are trying to cultivate organic intellectualism through a participative research process.

**According to Deleuze**

> The world is emerging: whenever people act creatively, they change the world and therewith themselves’. The usefulness of this methodology to a rapidly changing research field is clear: it is an emancipatory approach that responds creatively to change as the central hallmark of life. It thus has much in common with the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze,

## Motivation & Concept
The crisis of the contemporary (and conventional) participation forms of the liberal democracy has been a central point in the political discourse for a long while. We are going through a rapid decline in the trust, participation, and quality decline in political representation forms. 

- Nicos Poulantzas (2002) was encapsulating his theory under the concept of authoritarian statism, whereas  
- A more popularised work by Colin Crouch named this crisis as Post-democracy

## High-Level Objectives
1. Mapping of the different activism types (we are focusing on activism, not just "alternative participation forms", whatever that might mean.)
	- Different thematic areas in activism
	- Different types of activism
	- Profiling activity, classification of the 
		- Mass (how big the movements are)
		- Demands
		- Organisational structure
2. Engagement
	- Living Labs either by splitting into thematic areas
	- or by splitting into the different activism types
3. Cultivation of the engagement results
	- The initial goal of the living labs is to mimic an alternative policy-making process.
	- Therefore after generating enough content, the participating groups also scrutinise the results to *build* a hypothetical policy-making process whereas they will:
		- define the key demands from the whole participative process in living labs 
		- describe what kind of missing functionality made these demands hard to integrate into the conventional policymaking processes
		- describe what kind of changes (if any) could lead to a more fitting policy-making structure
4. Turn the lab results into presentations:
	- It can be a conventional presentation form, it can be an artwork, it can be both but it needs to be a *performance* that should be capable to communicate the results from the labs to the policymakers and maybe also analysts.
	- Participants from each group are also to decide who will be doing the presentation/ performance.
5. Bringing policymakers, and selected activist from each lab group as focus groups together:
	- Format:
		- The representatives of the living lab groups present their results, including
			- what are their demands
			- why are these demands not already in the policy cycle
			- what would be the change that would make it possible
		- Policymaker/analyst reflection
6. Policy framework results are to be rendered into a report, and presentations and reports are to be displayed on an online platform along with the results of the discussions with the policymakers.

## Preliminary WP-Structure
**WP1** Mapping, Recruitment, Engagement Processes:
  T1: Stakeholder Mapping, classification of the activist groups
  T2: Recruitment of a broad activist basis
  T3: Engagement workshops and other activities
  T4: Rendering the engagement results.
**WP2**  Mimicking and (alternative) policy framework & Preparation of the creative presentation forms (of the living lab results)
**WP3** Communications with the policy-makers and analysts in the form of focus groups
(WP or task) Policy framework formalisation through the results in the discourse between activist groups (living lab participants) and policymakers.
**WP5** Monitoring & Coordination

## Questions to myself
!. Are socially innovative activism transferable? Can we re-use successful (and alternative participation forms)
