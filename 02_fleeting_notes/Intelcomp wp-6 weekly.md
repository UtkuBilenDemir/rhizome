# Intelcomp wp-6 weekly
created: 2022-05-12 10:09

STI viewer training was benefitial.

**Jero**:

[[Model Trainer]] won't be available until September. It will be available as a web service, you don't have to install anything. It will be ready to go.

Services running in a python environment (not everyone can easily run it)

What kind of activities for co-creation:

- 3 different:
	- Revise what is the functionalities we are providing with the tools: we can create models -> evaluate the results
	- Creation of models themselves, create models for a specific selection of models etc.
	- We already have a mock-up, there will be updates to mock-up, please give us feedback about the mock-up so we can develop further

- [[Model Trainer]]
- [[Domain Selection]]
- [[Topic Modelling]]: product owners can curate models themselves, requirements etc. 
	- To note: there might be larger scope of users than anticipated, we can provide support to the many different type of users but the product owners should identify them clearly.

Can all the reviewers communicate with product owners?

**The scope of the mock-up is Domain Selection and Topic Modelling. Doesn't include Model Trainer yet and we won't be waiting for the Model Trainer**
These are already enough to shape models. Additionally, **only a fraction of the data** is available right now.

Backend components will be available in June already, the front end needs time at least until September -> How functional it will be until then? Can't make any promises. 

We can provide examples (of front end) until then but it probably won't be *testable*

New tools will be available in model trainer. After September we will definitely have a co-creation ready tool.

Someone from the development will be reviewing the timelines (either Carlos or someone else) on the LL-MiroBoard.

## Interactive Model Trainer:
LLs will be discussing internally, if and 

**David**:
Who can run the prototype, are external people allowed to run the code and test to tool.

*If they invest their own times, of course as a LL-stakeholder otherwise it would mean recruiting new partners which wouldn't be possible in the frame of the GA.*

Product owner:
*How about one person from each LL who will play the role "product owner"*

How much python expertise needed? 

How much time would we need to invest to test the tool? Does it really worth to invest time in it right now? Is the tool *ready* enough?

U: I will test it anyway, I can 

**TASKS**

Instructions are relatively clear but the LLs got the email a little too late and couldn't make it until the meeting.

How far are you with the optimisation of the timeline?
We need to go hand in hand with the development side, in order to update the timeline we have to align our thoughts with the technical teams.
We need to wait a little bit, soon we will be receiving the updates.

Our idea is to give you tasks at the meeting (Thursday) and then expect the contributions until Tuesday, if that's ok. 

It's great for the partners because they have to align those with our other workload. 

**LL-AI**: we are trying to improve our timeline. We already entered the main events but there are also intermediate steps/events. The context of some events need to be adapted to the goals of the project, some of them are out of the scope. Quite a few of them are preliminary plans. 

The instructions were not clear, should we create a matrix of processes and goals?
*yes*
Matrix is ok

but

Monitoring part was not clear, we don't know how to proceed
*We will come up with input that will help you*

**LL-Health**
We completed the timeline (vertical)

We already had meetings about the needs â€¦ Now we need the technical feedback/response so we can proceed. We have already a very wide info, we have the policy questions .. We need the technical point of view to proceed.

We did not understand the second question, that's why we couldn't contribute.
