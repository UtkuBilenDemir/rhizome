# Deleuze, Bartleby; or, the Formula
## Metadata


## Highlights
This is an agrammatical formula that stands as the limit of a series of correct expressions: J'en ai de trop, Je n'en ai pas assez, II m'en manque un ..“I have too many,” “I don't have enough,” “I am one short” ...). Would not Bartleby's formula be of this type, at once a stereotypy of Bartleby's and a highly poetic expression of Melville's, the limit of a series such as “I would prefer this. I would prefer not to do that. That is not what I would prefer ...”? Despite its quite normal construction, it has an anomalous ring to it — location: []() ^ref-50532

If need be, other languages will be summoned into English in order to make it echo this divine language of storm and thunder. Melville invents a foreign language that runs beneath English and carries it off: it is the OUTLANDISH or Deterritorialized, the language of the Whale. — location: []() ^ref-51601
