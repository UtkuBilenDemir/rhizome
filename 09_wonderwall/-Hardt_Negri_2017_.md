## Highlights
Save few exceptions, these movements either have abandoned their radical aspirations and become players in the existing systems or have been defeated by ferocious repression — location: []() ^ref-53103

Everything turns,” as Hegel says, “on grasping and expressing the True not only as Substance, but equally as Subject.”1 We must train our eyes to recognize how the movements have the potential to redefne fundamental social relations so that they strive not to — location: []() ^ref-49500

The most powerful social movements today treat leadership as a dirty word—and for many good reasons. For more than a half century activists have rightly criticized how centralized, vertical forms of organization, including charismatic fgures, leadership councils, party structures, and bureaucratic institutions, become fetters to the development of democracy and the full participation of all in political life. Gone are the days, on the one hand, when a political vanguard could successfully take power in the name of the masses; the claims of political realism and the presumed efectiveness of such centralized leadership have proved completely illusory — location: []() ^ref-2378

---
This is not an elimination of leadership, then, but an inversion of the political relationship that constitutes it, a reversal of the polarity that links horizontal movements and vertical leadership — location: []() ^ref-8074

People together are ever more able to determine how they will cooperate with each other socially, how they will manage their relations to each other and their world, and how they will generate new combinations of human and nonhuman forces, social and digital machines, material and immaterial elements. From this standpoint we can see, in fact, that transforming the common into private property, closing access and imposing a monopoly of decision-making over its use and development, becomes a fetter to future productivity. We are all more productive the more we have access to knowledges, the more we are able to cooperate and communicate with each other, the more we share resources and wealth — location: []() ^ref-19815

And yet there is much more at play.Fortunately, there are myriad forms of daily resistance and the episodic but repeated revolt of potent social movements. One has to wonder if the contempt with which the powerful hold the travails of rebels and protesters (and the insinuation that they will never succeed in organizing if not subordinated to traditional leadership) does not mask their dread that the movements will proceed from resistance to insurrection—and thus their fear of losing control. They know (or suspect) that power is never as secure and self-sufcient as it pretends to be — location: []() ^ref-64287

That production of subjectivity is made possible by the fact that truth is not given but constructed, not substance but subject. The power to make and to construct is here an index of truth. In the processes of subjectivation that are developed and enacted in practice, a truth and an ethics thus arise from below — location: []() ^ref-19574

---
most people recognize all this but feel powerless to make any change — location: []() ^ref-8306

Many assume that if only social movements could fnd new leaders they would return to their earlier glory and be able to sustain and achieve projects of social transformation and liberation. Where, they ask, are the new Martin Luther King Jr.’s, Rudi Dutschkes, Patrice Lumumbas, and Stephen Bikos? Where have all the leaders gone — location: []() ^ref-38855

First, by too quickly dissolving the central committee of the Commune and putting decision-making immediately in the hands of the people, the Communards are overly dogmatic in their attachment to democracy. Second, by not pursuing the retreating troops of the Third Republic to Versailles while they have the military advantage in March, the Communards are led astray by their devotion to nonviolence and peace. The Communards are too angelic in Marx’s view, and their lack of leadership contributes to their defeat in May, just two months after their historic victory. The Commune is destroyed and by the thousands Communards are executed or exiled by a victorious bourgeoisie untroubled by any angelic inhibitions. But if the Communards had not committed these “errors,” wouldn’t they have—even if they had survived—negated the inspiring democratic core of their project? For many that is the Gordian knot — location: []() ^ref-49836

what is the relationship between the action of representatives and will of the represented? In very general terms, the two primary responses to this question point in opposite directions: one afrms that power can and must be grounded solidly in its popular constituents, that, through representation, the people’s will is expressed in power; and the other claims that sovereign authority, even popular sovereignty, must through the mechanisms of representation be separated and shielded from the will of the constituents. The trick is that all forms of modern representation combine, in diferent measures, these two seemingly contradictory mandates. Representation connects and cuts — location: []() ^ref-22153

The immune systems of the movements have become so developed that every emergence of the leadership virus is immediately attacked by antibodies — location: []() ^ref-37371
