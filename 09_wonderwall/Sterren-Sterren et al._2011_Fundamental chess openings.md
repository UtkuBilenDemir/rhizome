# Sterren et al._2011_Fundamental chess openings
## Metadata
* Author: [[Paul van der Sterren]]

## Highlights
The Taimanov, the Paulsen and the Scheveningen are the great main lines in this position. There are also a few smaller variations, among which one is especially notable because it lies on the very edge of what is possible, both positionally and tactically: 4...Nf6 5 Nc3 Bb4 (D), the Pin Variation. â€” location: [11774]() ^ref-31364
