## Highlights
The polynomial that is identically 0 is said to have degree −∞ — location: []() ^ref-42689

A list (v1, ... , vm) of vectors in V is called linearly independent if the only choice of a1, ... , am ∈ F that makes a1v1 + · · · + amvm equal 0 is a1 = · · · = am = 0. For example, — location: []() ^ref-51149

Infnite-dimensional vector spaces, which we will not mention much anymore, are the center of attention in the branch of mathematics called functional analysis. Functional analysis uses tools from both analysis and algebra — location: []() ^ref-20971

Most linear algebra texts defne linearly independent sets instead of linearly independent lists. With that defnition, the set {(0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0)} is linearly independent in F2 because it equals the set {(0, 1), (1, 0)}. With our defnition, the list (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0) is not linearly independent (because 1 times the frst vector plus −1 times the second vector plus 0 times the third vector equals 0). By dealing with lists instead of sets, we will avoid some problems associated with the usual approach — location: []() ^ref-2749

1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0) is linearly independent in F4, as you should verify. The reasoning in the previous paragraph shows that (v1, ... , vm) is linearly independent if and only if each vector in span(v1, ... , vm) has only one representation as a linear combination of (v1, ... , vm) — location: []() ^ref-25957

---
any list of vectors containing the 0 vector is linearly dependent — location: []() ^ref-62552

---
this to remain true even if we remove all the vectors, we declare the empty list () to be linearly independent — location: []() ^ref-978

The real vector space R2 has dimension 2; the complex vector space C has dimension 1. As sets, R2 can be identifed with C (and addition is the same on both spaces, as is scalar multiplication by real numbers). Thus when we talk about the dimension of a vector space, the role played by the choice of F cannot be neglected — location: []() ^ref-8475

---
the last proposition implies that this linearly independent list of length 2 is a basis of F2 (we do not need to bother checking that it spans — location: []() ^ref-37779

---
standard functional notation T(v). The set of all linear maps from V to W is denoted L(V, W ). Let’s look at some examples of linear maps. Make sure you verify that each of the functions defned below is indeed a linear map — location: []() ^ref-2260
