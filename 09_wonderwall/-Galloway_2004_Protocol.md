## Highlights
This book—Protocol—points to one possible path for doing this. Throughout the discussions on power, control, and decentralization, Protocol consistently makes a case for a material understanding of technology. “Material” can be taken in all senses of the term, as an ontological category as well as a political and economic one. This type of materialist media studies shows how the question “how does it work?” is also the question “whom does it work for?” In short, the technical specs matter, ontologically and politically. As Galloway states here, “I attempt to read the never-ending stream of computer code as we read any text, decoding its structure of control.” But this is clearly not literary criticism. Nor is it semiotics—textual, visual, or otherwise. This is because computer code is always enacted. Code is a set of procedures, actions, and practices, designed in particular ways to achieve particular ends in particular contexts. Code = praxis — location: []() ^ref-4303

Further, code is not necessarily language, and certainly not a sign. A code, in the sense that Protocol defnes it, is process-based: It is parsed, compiled, procedural or object-oriented, and defned by ontology standards. A code is a series of activated mechanical gears, or a stack of punched cards circulating through a tape-reading machine, or a fow — location: []() ^ref-21303

When the book suggests that networks are not metaphors (or not merely metaphors), the dichotomy is not one between material and immaterial, but rather between two types of “abstract.” On the one hand there is an abstract use of the concept of networks generally to signify any relationship between discrete entities. According to this usage, just about anything can be seen as a network (and thus the overwhelmingly wide application of certain network science or complexity approaches). But there is also another meaning of “abstract,” one that is not the opposite of concrete. An abstract that is real is a potential. (Henri Bergson uses the term “virtual” for the immanent unfolding of duration as potentiality.) This is not the abstract use of network as a term, and neither is it an abstraction of a technical term (the metaphorization of technological terms). Rather, this abstract-but-real is the network that is always enacted and always about to enact itself. One can pose the question: Is a network a network if it is not being used? Is the Internet a network because of its fber-optic cables, its usage, its data transfer, the standards for such use, or the concepts that inform the development of network technology itself? Likely all of these. With multiple local agencies and several interests at stake, information networks like the Internet are always about to do something. In this sense networks are constantly materializing their logics (their formal logics as much as their organizational and political logics). The network as real-but-abstract may involve “information” as an immaterial entity, but that information always works toward real effects and transformations, no matter how localized. Thus, in an important way, networks are not metaphors. The network metaphor is misleading, limiting. It only provides a general model for discussing relationships (linking, hybridity, boundaries, heterogeneity — location: []() ^ref-25890

This is what Protocol does. It asks how a particular type of network functions—the information networks that undergird the Internet. It shows how a network is not simply a free-for-all of information “out there,” nor is it a dystopia of databanks owned by corporations. It is a set of technical procedures for defning, managing, modulating, and distributing information throughout a fexible yet robust delivery infrastructure — location: []() ^ref-4878

On the one hand, TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) enables the Internet to create horizontal distributions of information from one computer to another. On the other, the DNS (Domain Name System) vertically stratifes that horizontal logic through a set of regulatory bodies that manage Internet addresses and names. Understanding these two dynamics in the Internet means understanding the essential ambivalence in the way that power functions in control societies. As Protocol states, “the founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom— control has existed from the beginning.” To grasp “protocol” is to grasp the technical and the political dynamics of TCP/IP and DNS at the same time. What are some common metaphoric uses of networks that Protocol resists — location: []() ^ref-54613

At the center of such changes is the issue of political and technological adaptation, situated between centralized control and decentralized regulation — location: []() ^ref-54555

---
The central political question that Protocol asks is where the power has gone. If we are indeed living in a post-industrial, postmodern, postdemocratic society, how does one account for political agency in situations in which agency appears to be either caught in networks of power or distributed across multiple agencies — location: []() ^ref-13068

Information does fow, but it does so in a highly regulated manner. This dual property (regulated fow) is central to Protocol’s analysis of the Internet as a political technology — location: []() ^ref-34884

Portability is a central characteristic of software development. Mac or PC? Netscape or IE? The ability to enable software and fles to operate across different proprietary standards is a key aspect of software development. In a sense, layering cannot happen without at least a cursory consideration of portability. Portability is not always the will to make something portable; more often than not it is the strategic disabling of portability that is of concern to software companies — location: []() ^ref-17536
