## Highlights
As Kazin points out, until 1940 the notion of a conservative populism was an oxymoron. There was no connection between populism and the discourse of the traditional Right, which was centred on the defence of unregulated capitalism and the discouragement of any kind of grass-roots mobilization. The first moment in which a conservative discourse with populist connotation arises is in the anti-Communist crusades of the 1950s, whose epicentre was McCarthyism but which had been preceded by a series of molecular processes on a variety of fronts. There was certainly an anti-Communist component, but it was immediately associated with the conservative fear of a powerful government machine controlled by the liberal elites of the Northwest. Once these two components started feeding on each other, it was easy to move from the second to some traditional populist themes: — location: [2285]() ^ref-16395

while the link between ‘people’ and ‘workers’ was replaced by an appeal to the average man: ‘working man’ and ‘Joe worker’ tended to be replaced by ‘regular guy’, ‘average Joe’ and ‘average American’. — location: [2297]() ^ref-8559

new equivalential chains are formed – that is, we move to a new hegemonic formation – or the Republicans will be re-elected. What is pure illusion is to think that their long-term defeat could take place without some kind of drastic rearticulation of the political imaginary (the situation is too polarized for small changes in one direction or the other to be able to make any material difference). — location: [2349]() ^ref-54144

Let us consider, in our initial diagram (p. 130), the lower semicircles in the circles representing the individual demands. While the upper semicircle points to the strictly equivalential moment (what the various demands share in their common opposition to the oppressive regime), the lower one represents the irreducible particularism of each individual demand. — location: [2357]() ^ref-27213

antagonistic camp is fully represented as the negative reverse of a popular identity which would not exist without that negative reference; but in the case of an outside which is opposed to the inside just because it does not have access to the space of representation, ‘opposition’ means simply ‘leaving aside’ and, as such, it does not in any sense shape the identity of what is inside. — location: [2369]() ^ref-34961

this ambiguity in relation to the enemy cannot be superseded. This, to some extent, corresponds to the well-known fact that forces which have constructed their antagonism on a certain terrain show their secret solidarity when it is that very terrain which is put into question. It is like the reaction of two chess players to somebody who kicks the board. — location: [2386]() ^ref-56774

There were also, of course, the poor, who were in excess of that classification, but could be dealt with through ad hoc procedures – the Poor Laws in England, for example. In Germany after the 1830s, however, this heterogeneous excess started to increase in alarming proportions, for reasons not so much related to incipient industrialization but, rather, to its opposite:15 an inadequate industrial development which was unable to replace an economic structure dislocated by a plurality of factors – rapid population growth, emancipation from serfdom, enclosures, suppression of feudal distinctions in the towns, and so forth. These were the parameters of the social question as it presented itself in Germany at the time. Hegel was well aware of the problem, but the closest he came to proposing a solution was his suggestion that the excess population should be encouraged to emigrate to the overseas colonies. — location: [2414]() ^ref-54727

‘proletarian’ was used to designate this new agent. In order to maintain its credentials as an ‘insider’ of the main line of historical development, however, the proletariat had to be strictly differentiated from the absolute ‘outsider’: the lumpenproletariat. — location: [2441]() ^ref-9462

Once the ‘outside’ of production is conceived at this level of generality, it is difficult to exclude it from the field of historicity. — location: [2469]() ^ref-13859

Almost immediately, however, he has to qualify his judgement by asserting that the peasants, given their dispersion, do not constitute a class but a simple aggregation, ‘much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes’. This gives the Bonapartist state a higher degree of autonomy than that enjoyed by other regimes which depend on a more structured social base. Later, however, Marx rejected this solution, and saw Bonapartism as depending on a heterogeneous social basis which made it possible for the state to move in between different classes. This, according to Stallybrass, is the beginning of a crisis in Marxist theory. This crisis is synonymous with the emergence of political articulation as absolutely constitutive of the social link: — location: [2473]() ^ref-9538

This means that the antagonism is not inherent to the relations of production but it is established between the relations of production and an identity which is external to them. Ergo, in social antagonisms we are dealing with a heterogeneity which is not dialectically retrievable. — location: [2541]() ^ref-54331

we know now that, strictly speaking, without heterogeneity there would not be antagonism either. — location: [2544]() ^ref-18007

Let us start from the conclusion we reached in our last paragraph: antagonism presupposes heterogeneity because the resistance of the antagonized force cannot be logically derived from the form of the antagonizing one. This can only mean that the points of resistance to the antagonizing force are always going to be external to it. So there are no a priori privileged points of rupture and contestation; particularly intense antagonistic points can only be contextually established, never deduced from the internal logic of either of the two opposed forces taken in isolation. In practical terms – going back to the earlier example – there is no reason why struggles taking place within relations of production should be the privileged points of a global anti-capitalist struggle. A globalized capitalism creates myriad points of rupture and antagonisms – ecological crises, imbalance between different sectors of the economy, massive unemployment, and so on – and only an overdetermination of this antagonistic plurality can create global anti-capitalist subjects capable of carrying out a struggle worth the name. — location: [2546]() ^ref-56146

And, as all historical experience shows, it is impossible to determine a priori who the hegemonic actors in this struggle will be. It is by no means clear that they will be the workers. All we know is that they will be the outsiders of the system, the underdogs – those we have called the heterogeneous – who are decisive in the establishment of an antagonistic frontier. This means that the expansion of the category of lumpenproletariat – which, as we have seen, was already taking place in the work of the later Marx – at this point attains its full potential. — location: [2554]() ^ref-24326

Not everything in society is political, because we have many sedimented social forms which have blurred the traces of their original political institution; but if heterogeneity is constitutive of the social bond, we are always going to have a political dimension by which society – and the ‘people’ – are constantly reinvented. — location: [2622]() ^ref-26167

---
Since the construction of the ‘people’ is the political act par excellence – as opposed to pure administration within a stable institutional framework – the sine qua non requirements of the political are the constitution of antagonistic frontiers within the social and the appeal to new subjects of social change – which involves, as we know, the production of empty signifiers in order to unify a multiplicity of heterogeneous demands in equivalential chains.

Here our exploration comes to an end. The emergence of the ‘people’ depends on the three variables I have isolated: equivalential relations hegemonically represented through empty signifiers; displacements of the internal frontiers through the production of floating signifiers; and a constitutive heterogeneity which makes dialectical retrievals impossible29 and gives its true centrality to political articulation. We have now reached a fully developed notion of populism. — location: [2654]() ^ref-48749
