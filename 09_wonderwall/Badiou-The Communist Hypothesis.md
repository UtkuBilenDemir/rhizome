## Highlights
Lumping together Stalin and Hitler was already a sign of extreme intellectual poverty: the norm by which any collective undertaking has to be judged is, it was argued, the number of deaths it causes. If that were really the case, the huge colonial genocides and massacres, the millions of deaths in the civil and world wars through which our West — location: [53]() ^ref-62706

for example, that ‘Fermat’s theorem’ is a hypothesis if we formulate it as: ‘For >n, I assume that the equation xn + yn = zn has no whole solutions (solutions in which x, y and z are whole numbers).’ Countless attempts were made to prove this, from Fermat, who formulated the hypothesis (and claimed to have proved it, but that need not concern us here), to Wiles, the English mathematician, who really did prove it a few years ago. Many of those attempts became the starting point for mathematical developments of great import, even though they did not succeed in solving the problem itself. It was therefore vital not to abandon the hypothesis for the three hundred years during which it was impossible to prove it. The lessons of all the failures, and the process of examining them and their implications, were the lifeblood of mathematics. — location: [80]() ^ref-53696

As we can see, the failure for which Céphas finds himself so ill-suited is the rightist failure, the ‘slow’, inglorious failure of reconstructions and repetitions. The moment when we revert from revolution to state. — location: [221]() ^ref-30245

The failure of false convergence

---
We can see from all this that ‘failing’ is always very close to ‘winning’. One of the great Maoist slogans of the ‘red years’ was ‘Dare to struggle and dare to win.’ But we know that it is not easy to follow that slogan when subjectivity is afraid, not of fighting, but of winning. Struggle exposes us to the simple form of failure (the assault did not succeed), while victory exposes us to its most redoubtable form: we notice that we have won in vain, and that our victory paves the way for repetition and restoration. That, for the state, a revolution is never anything more than an intervening period. Hence the sacrificial temptations of nothingness. For a politics of emancipation, the enemy that is to be feared most is not repression at the hands of the established order. It is the interiority of nihilism, and the unbounded cruelty that can come with its emptiness. — location: [297]() ^ref-17706

The best known, or the most circumscribed, is the failure of an attempt in which revolutionaries who have briefly taken power over a country or a zone and tried to establish new laws — location: [305]() ^ref-23348

are crushed by an armed counter-revolution. — location: [306]() ^ref-2363

second type of failure is that of a broad movement involving disparate but very large forces whose goal is not really the seizure of power, even though they have forced the reactionary forces of the state on to the defensive for long periods of time. — location: [316]() ^ref-32571

---
The third type of failure concerns an attempt to transform a state that officially declares itself to be socialist, and to bring it into line with the idea of a free association, which, ever since Marx, has always seemed to be stipulated by the communist hypothesis. In such cases, the failure is that the outcome takes us in the opposite direction: either the terrorism of the party-state is restored, any reference to socialism, and a fortiori communism, is abandoned, or the state rallies to the non-egalitarian constraints of capitalism, or both those things happen, as one paves the way for the other. — location: [323]() ^ref-60210

---
The old conception we were trying to break away from at this time was based on the dominant idea (shared by activists of all kinds and in that sense universally accepted inside the ‘revolutionary’ camp) that there is such a thing as a historical agent offering a possibility of emancipation. — location: [461]() ^ref-59237

---
At the time, we assumed that the politics of emancipation was neither a pure idea, an expression of the will nor a moral dictate, but that it was inscribed in, and almost programmed by, historical and social reality. — location: [466]() ^ref-38533

But ‘communism’ also means forms of political organization that are not modelled on spatial hierarchies. — location: [532]() ^ref-58263

We must be able to go on saying ‘people’, ‘workers’, ‘abolition of private property’, and so on, without being considered has-beens, and without considering ourselves as has-beens. We have to discuss these words in our own field, in our own camp. We have to put an end to the linguistic terrorism that delivers us into the hands of our enemies. Giving up on the language issue, and accepting the terror that subjectively forbids us to pronounce words that offend dominant sensibilities, is an intolerable form of oppression. — location: [566]() ^ref-31143

The bourgeoisie had indeed found a convenient hiding place inside the party, and the means to forge its new power, as we can see from China today, now that it has embarked upon a nineteenth-century form of capital accumulation. The great movement of May ’68 has to be reread in the light of the obvious conclusion: that the ‘class party’ is at once a glorious formula and one that has become exhausted. The question of the new forms that an emancipatory political discipline will take is the central question of the communism to come. — location: [619]() ^ref-7129

the distinction between intellectual labour and manual labour. It is therefore essential to educate the ‘middle strata’ on a mass but differentiated basis: giving them a taste of secondary, or even higher, education marks in indelible terms their sense of distance and their fear of being proletarianized. — location: [634]() ^ref-57155

Long instilled by religious institutions, that ignorance safeguarded, thanks to the obscurantism it fostered amongst the peasant masses, the cornerstone of the French bourgeoisie’s strategy from 1794 onwards: an alliance with rural producers. In the towns, this task was to some extent delegated to secular educational apparatuses. The educational system was therefore the institution that was always given the task of overcoming the following contradiction: how can the theoretical consciousness of ever-expanding groups be heightened without calling into question the supremacy of bourgeois ideology, which is based upon ignorance and intellectual repression? — location: [638]() ^ref-28422

Allience between bourgeoisie through education?

‘Pure’ theoretical practice (the sciences) was divorced from ideological education (the humanities) as though they were two different essences, and everyone was required to choose between the two on the basis of their so-called ‘gifts’, which the system took upon itself to detect. — location: [647]() ^ref-24676

Gaullism. This regime, which is bound up with the national tradition of Bonapartism, is attempting to forge a direct alliance between the haute bourgeoisie (which wields power without any intermediaries: Pompidou and his clique) and classes or social strata that are traditionally unorganized: the peasantry, the parasites in the retail sector, that fraction of the working masses that has been discouraged by the capitulation of the communists but which, in the absence of any ideological support, lapses into economistic spontaneism and the cult of state authority. — location: [694]() ^ref-63581

the confrontation between positions cannot be ruled by bureaucratic formalism, but neither can it be ruled by the methods of terrorist purging that Stalin used in the thirties. In the space of the party-state, though, there is only formalism or terror. — location: [979]() ^ref-37771

Mao and his followers will go so far as to say that under socialism, the bourgeoisie reconstitutes itself and organizes itself within the Communist Party itself. On the other hand, with actual civil war still being excluded, the general form of the relation between the party and the state, in particular concerning the use of repressive forces, must remain unchanged at least in so far as it is not really a question of destroying the party. Mao will make this known by noting that ‘the overwhelming majority of cadres are good’. — location: [988]() ^ref-7376

From this we will draw the conclusion that every political organization must be transgenerational, and that it is a bad idea to organize the political separation of youth. — location: [1115]() ^ref-41160

This seizure of power is immediately paradoxical. On the one hand, like the Decision in Sixteen Points above, it finds inspiration in a complete counter-model of the party-state: the coalition of the most disparate organizations that constituted the Paris Commune and whose ineffective anarchy had already been criticized by Marx. On the other hand, this counter-model has no possibility of national development in so far as on the national level the figure of the party remains the only one allowed, even if a number of its traditional elements are in crisis. — location: [1151]() ^ref-42243

What now becomes evident is the fundamental role of the popular army as a pillar in the Chinese party-state. The army has been given a stabilizing role in the Revolution, having been asked to support the rebel left, but there is no expectation or any tolerance for its division, which would set the scene for civil war on a large scale. — location: [1239]() ^ref-65185

I would nonetheless like to make a few remarks in passing. On the one hand, this kind of devotion, as well as the conflict of interpretations, is totally commonplace in established religions, and among us, without being considered a pathology. — location: [1288]() ^ref-57912

---
From a general point of view, the ‘cult of personality’ is tied to the thesis according to which the party, as representative of the working class, is the hegemonic source of politics, the mandatory guardian of the correct line. As was said in the thirties, ‘the Party is always right’. The problem is that nothing can guarantee such a representation, nor such a hyperbolic certainty as to the source of rationality. By way of a substitute for such a guarantee, it thus becomes crucial for there to be a representation of the representation, one that would be a singularity, legitimated precisely by its singularity alone. Finally, one person, a single body, comes to stand for this superior guarantee, in the classical aesthetic form of genius. — location: [1300]() ^ref-63544

---
For the communist parties, between the twenties and sixties, personal genius is only the incarnation, the fixed point, of the doubtful representative capacity of the party; it is easier to believe in the rectitude and the intellectual force of a distant and solitary man than in the truth and purity of an apparatus whose local petty chiefs are well known. — location: [1306]() ^ref-5827

He is also the one who encourages the rebels, who spreads the slogan ‘it is right to revolt’, and encourages troubles, at the very moment when he is being canonized as the party’s chairman. — location: [1311]() ^ref-33226

---
revolutionary masses he is less the guarantee of the really existing party than the incarnation, all by himself, of a proletarian party that is still to come. He is somewhat like a revenge of singularity upon representation. — location: [1313]() ^ref-64086

---
Ultimately, we should maintain that ‘Mao’ is a name that is intrinsically contradictory in the field of revolutionary politics. On the one hand, it is the supreme name of the party-state, its undeniable chairman, he who, as military leader and founder of the regime, holds the historical legitimacy of the Communist Party. On the other hand, ‘Mao’ is the name of that which, in the party, cannot be reduced to the state’s bureaucracy. — location: [1315]() ^ref-55131

---
‘Mao’ is the name of a paradox: the rebel in power, the dialectician put to the test by the continuing needs of ‘development’, the emblem of the party-state in search of its overcoming, the military chief preaching disobedience to the authorities …10 This is what has given to his ‘cult’ a frenetic appearance, because subjectively he accumulated the accord given to the stately pomp of the Stalinist type, together with the enthusiasm of the entire revolutionary youth for the old rebel who cannot be satisfied with the existing state of affairs, — location: [1322]() ^ref-7329

and yet at the same time without lapsing into the figure of anarchism, which has never been anything else than the vain critique, or the double, or the shadow, of the communist parties, just as the black flag is only the double or the shadow of the red flag. — location: [1333]() ^ref-8454

By 20 August, arriving from high-school and university institutions, activist groups of ‘Red Guards’ spread out in the city, in order to ‘destroy completely the old thought, culture, customs and habits’. In particular, a very harsh persecution of intellectuals and professors, once more considered, according to Mao himself, as ‘evil geniuses’. — location: [1400]() ^ref-8749

Of course, when I say ‘our’ history, it has to do with the ‘we’ of a politics of emancipation, the ‘we’ whose virtual flag remains red, and not the tri-coloured one flown by the killers of the spring of 1871. — location: [1473]() ^ref-56749

The fundamental cause of the failure of the Paris Commune was that, owing to the historical conditions, Marxism had not yet achieved a dominant position in the workers’ movement and a proletarian revolutionary Party with Marxism as its guiding thought had not yet come into being. — location: [1649]() ^ref-63763

---
Although the final citation about the Party is by Mao, it could have just as easily been by Stalin. This is why, in spite of its activism and its militancy, the Maoist vision of the Commune ultimately remained prisoner of the party-state framework and, hence, of what I have called the ‘first account’. — location: [1654]() ^ref-48493

But first a structural definition is essential: Let’s call ‘the left’ the set of parliamentary political personnel that proclaim that they are the only ones equipped to bear the general consequences of a singular political movement. Or, in more contemporary terms, that they are the only ones able to provide ‘social movements’ with a ‘political perspective’. — location: [1700]() ^ref-49529

---
True, after being crushed, leftist ‘memory’ absorbed the Commune. The mediation of that paradoxical incorporation took the form of a parliamentary combat for amnesty for exiled or still-imprisoned Communards. Through this combat the left hoped for a risk-free consolidation of its electoral power. After that came the epoch – about which I’ve said a word – of commemorations. — location: [1711]() ^ref-55295

a site is a multiple that happens to behave in the situation with regard to itself as with regard to its elements, in such a way as to support the being of its own appearing. Even if the idea is still obscure, we can begin to see its content: a site is a singularity because it evokes its being in the appearing of its own multiple composition. It makes itself, in the world, the being-there of its being. Among other consequences, this means that the site gives itself an intensity of existence. A site is a being that happens to exist by itself. — location: [1721]() ^ref-1839

For the vast majority of people, including often the workers themselves, the politicized workers of Paris are simply incomprehensible. These workers are the non-existent aspect [l’inexistant propre] of the term ‘political capacity’ in the uncertain world of the spring of 1871. — location: [1744]() ^ref-31272

---
What is, exactly, in terms of its manifest content, this beginning called 18 March? Our answer is: the appearing of a worker-being – to this very day a social symptom, the brute force of uprisings, and a theoretical threat – in the space of governmental and political capacity. — location: [1754]() ^ref-57969

Yet a site must be thought not simply in terms of the ontological particularity that I have just identified, but also according to the logical unfolding of its consequences. — location: [1794]() ^ref-34167

If an element a of a situation is such that the existence of a has a value of p, and if the element b of the same situation exists to the degree of q, we can postulate that b will be a consequence of a in equal measure to the dependency of these intensities, or, if you like, their order. If, for example, on the scale measuring the intensities of existence proper to a certain situation, q is greatly inferior to p, we can validate the dependency of b to a. We can say, then, that a consequence is a strong or weak relation between existences. The degree to which one thing is the consequence of another is never independent of the intensity of existence they have in the situation under consideration. The aforementioned declaration of the Central Committee of 10 May 1871, then, may be read as a thesis on the consequences. It registers: — location: [1803]() ^ref-20823

We will call a site whose intensity of existence is not maximal a fact. We will call a site whose intensity of existence is maximal a singularity. — location: [1852]() ^ref-5287

When a world finally comes to be situated – from what becomes of the site in it – and is placed between singularity and fact, then it is down to the network of consequences that it comes to decide. — location: [1861]() ^ref-16996

Fact &singularity

---
Let’s posit then that 4 September is a weak singularity, because it is aligned on the general development of European states, which converge on the parliamentary form. Moreover, let’s say that the Commune is a strong singularity because it proposes to thought a rule of emancipation, and is relayed – perhaps against the grain – by October 1917 and, more specifically, by the summer of 1967 in China, and May 1968 in France. — location: [1881]() ^ref-6347

---
And indeed: the unknown members of the Central Committee, who were politically inexistent in the world the day before, come to exist absolutely the same day as their appearing. — location: [1908]() ^ref-3591

---
The paradox can be analysed under three headings. In the first place, the principle of this overturning of worldly appearing from inexistence to absolute existence is a vanishing principle. All the event’s power is consumed in the existential transfiguration. As evental multiplicity, 18 March 1871 has not the least stability. — location: [1910]() ^ref-35193

---
the subversion of worldly appearing by subjacent being is played out. It is the logical marking of a paradox of being, an ontological chimera. — location: [1918]() ^ref-15128

‘Three times [in 1792, in 1848 and in 1870] the French proletariat made the Republic for others; now it is ripe for its own.’ In other words, the Commune event, begun on 18 March 1871, did not have the effect of destroying the dominant group and its politicians. But something more important was destroyed: the political subordination of workers and the people. What was destroyed was of the order of subjective incapacity: ‘Oh!’ exclaims Lissagaray, ‘they are not uncertain of their capacities, these workers of the country and the towns.’ — location: [1926]() ^ref-11564

This possible is simply that of an independent proletarian politics. — location: [1933]() ^ref-8421

At the beginning of the twentieth century, what occupies the place of death is no longer worker political awareness [conscience], but – even if it was not yet realized – the prejudice that classes are natural in character, and that it is the millenary vocation of proprietors and the wealthy to conserve social and state power. The Paris Commune accomplished this destruction for the future, even in the apparent putting to death of its own super-existence [surexistence]. — location: [1936]() ^ref-10047

call an ‘Idea’ an abstract totalization of the three basic elements: a truth procedure, a belonging to history, and an individual subjectivation. A formal definition of the Idea can immediately be given: — location: [2049]() ^ref-60871

In other words, the communist Idea is the imaginary operation whereby an individual subjectivation projects a fragment of the political real into the symbolic narrative of a History. It is in this sense that one may appropriately say that the Idea is (as might be expected!) ideological. — location: [2081]() ^ref-23788

This was because the crucial axiom of the dialectic as he conceived of it was: ‘The True is the process of its own becoming’ or – what amounts to the same – ‘Time is the being-there of the concept’. As a result, in line with the Hegelian philosophical heritage, we are justified in thinking that, under the name of ‘communism’, the historical inscription of revolutionary political sequences or of the disparate fragments of collective emancipation reveals their truth: to move forward according to the meaning of History. This latent subordination of truths to their historical meaning entails that we can speak ‘in truth’ of communist politics, communist parties and communist militants. — location: [2088]() ^ref-42129

---
therefore true, transcendentally true, that it cannot exist. Discontinuity between worlds is the law of appearance, hence of existence. What does exist, however, under the real condition of organized political action, is the communist Idea, an operation tied to intellectual subjectivation and that integrates the real, the symbolic and the ideological at the level of the individual. — location: [2096]() ^ref-9866

---
We might also say that an event is the occurrence of the real as its own future possibility. — location: [2111]() ^ref-31696

!!!!!! EVENT

---
Another way of putting this is: with respect to a situation or a world, an event paves the way for the possibility of what – from the limited perspective of the make-up of this situation or the legality of this world – is strictly impossible. If we keep in mind here that, for Lacan, the real = the impossible, the intrinsically real aspect of the event will be readily seen. We might also say that an event is the occurrence of the real as its own future possibility. — location: [2108]() ^ref-18023

---
I call a ‘State’ or ‘state of the situation’ the system of constraints that limit the possibility of possibilities. By the same token, we will say that the State is that which prescribes what, in a given situation, is the impossibility specific to that situation, from the perspective of the formal prescription of what is possible. — location: [2111]() ^ref-27777

!!!!!!! STATE OF THE SITUATION

---
Through all these systems, all these apparatuses, including, of course, those that Althusser called ‘ideological State apparatuses’, which could be defined by their one common goal – preventing the communist Idea from designating a possibility – we can see how the State organizes and maintains, often by force, the distinction between what is possible and what isn’t. — location: [2116]() ^ref-55385

---
call a ‘truth procedure’ or a ‘truth’ an ongoing organization, in a given situation (or world), of the consequences of an event. It will be noted at once that a fundamental randomness, that of its evental origins, partakes in every truth. — location: [2120]() ^ref-34096

So it is clear that a truth cannot be made up of pure facts. — location: [2122]() ^ref-5686

History is neither subjective nor glorious. History should instead be said to be the history of the State. — location: [2128]() ^ref-12956

Why Spartacus, Thomas Müntzer, Robespierre, Toussaint Louverture, Blanqui, Marx, Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, Mao, Che Guevara and so many others? The reason is that all these proper names symbolize historically – in the guise of an individual, of a pure singularity of body and thought – the rare and precious network of ephemeral sequences of politics as truth. — location: [2165]() ^ref-46392

---
The second reason is that every event is a surprise. If this were not the case, it would mean that it would have been predictable as a fact, and so would be inscribed in the History of the State, which is a contradiction in terms. — location: [2209]() ^ref-41411

even if we are already currently militants of a previous event’s consequences, — location: [2211]() ^ref-3114

---
And since the forcing of the impossible into the possible occurs via subtraction from the power of the State, an Idea can be said to assert that this subtractive process is infinite: it is always formally possible that the dividing line drawn by the State between the possible and the impossible may once again be shifted, however radical its previous shifts – including the one in which we as militants are currently taking part – may have been. That is why one of the contents of the communist Idea today – as opposed to the theme of communism as a goal to be attained through the work of a new State – is that the withering away of the State, while undoubtedly a principle that must be apparent in any political action (which is expressed by the formula ‘politics at a distance from the State’ as an obligatory refusal of any direct inclusion in the State, of any request for funding from the State, of any participation in elections, etc.), is also an infinite task, since the creation of new political truths will always shift the dividing line between Statist, hence historical, facts and the eternal consequences of an event. — location: [2216]() ^ref-3400

Mao, ‘The people, and the people alone, are the active force in the making of world history … While we [communists] are often childish and ignorant.’5 We must therefore ensure as a matter of urgency that the political process that leads to communism – and therefore the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ – rediscovers its sources and its basic actors in popular mass uprisings, as it did in 1927, and not in the Party apparatchiks. — location: [2441]() ^ref-27258

(there must be a direct alliance between intellectual youth and the workers; we have to experiment with nonparty forms of organization; education must undergo a metamorphosis; the division of labour must be destroyed; power in the factories must be reorganized along democratic lines; new links must be established between town and countryside; we must create a new and popular intellectuality, and so on). The failure to do so means that we must abandon once and for all the militarized paradigm of the Party, and move towards what the Organisation politique in France calls a ‘politics without parties’. We have now reached that point, and we have reached it because the Cultural Revolution brought us here. — location: [2457]() ^ref-10985

But Delescluze, Vallès, Louise Michel, Varlin and Blanqui were no more responsible for the colonialism and corruption of the belle époque than Mao and his comrades are responsible for the China of the billionaires in Shanghai or for globalized corruption. The true descendants of the Communards are Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg and all the other revolutionaries who overcame the aporiae of the Commune, but still took it as a starting point. And their descendants are trying to find their way and experiment with ways to deal with the problem bequeathed them by the Cultural Revolution: that of a political process ‘without a party’, but which still takes as its starting point the universal aspects of that attempt to resolve it. — location: [2470]() ^ref-46999
