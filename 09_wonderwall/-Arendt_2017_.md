## Highlights
This transformation never occurred in the totalitarian, the Bolshevik and the Nazi movements. At the time it seized power the danger to the movement lay in the fact that, on one hand, it might become ‘ossified’ by taking over the state machine and frozen into a form of absolute government, fn1 and that, on the other hand, its freedom of movement might be limited by the borders of the territory in which it came to power. To a totalitarian movement, both dangers are equally deadly: a development toward absolutism would put an end to the movement’s interior drive, — location: []() ^ref-45981

The point is that both Hitler and Stalin held out promises of stability in order to hide their intention of creating a state of permanent instability — location: []() ^ref-58278

For the totalitarian ruler is confronted with a dual task which at first appears contradictory to the point of absurdity: he must establish the fictitious world of the movement as a tangible working reality of everyday life, and he must, on the other hand, prevent this new world from developing a new stability; for a stabilization of its laws and institutions would surely liquidate the movement itself and with it the hope for eventual world conquest. The totalitarian ruler must, at any price, prevent normalization from reaching the point where a new way of life could develop – one which might, after a time, lose its bastard qualities and take its place among the widely differing and profoundly contrasting ways of life of the nations of the earth. The moment the revolutionary institutions became a national way of life (that moment when Hitler’s claim that Nazism is not an export commodity or Stalin’s that socialism can be built in one country, would be more than an attempt to fool the nontotalitarian world), totalitarianism would lose its ‘total’ quality and become subject to the law of the nations, according to which each possesses a specific territory, people, and historical tradition which relates it to other nations – a plurality which ipso facto refutes every contention that any specific form of government is absolutely valid — location: []() ^ref-4514

The struggle for total domination of the total population of the earth, the elimination of every competing nontotalitarian reality, is inherent in the totalitarian regimes themselves; if they do not pursue global rule as their ultimate goal, they are only too likely to lose whatever power they have already seized. Even a single individual can be absolutely and reliably dominated only under global totalitarian conditions — location: []() ^ref-59320

History teaches that rise to power and responsibility affects deeply the nature of revolutionary parties. Experience and common sense were perfectly justified in expecting that totalitarianism in power would gradually lose its revolutionary momentum and utopian character, that the everyday business of government and the possession of real power would moderate the prepower claims of the movements and gradually destroy the fictitious world of their organizations — location: []() ^ref-54864

Rather, there was ‘only the constant going ahead on the road toward ever-new fields,’ so that finally the ‘purpose and scope of the secret state police’ as well as of all other state or party institutions created by the Nazis could ‘in no manner be covered by the laws and regulations issued for them.’fn9 In practice, this permanent state of lawlessness found expression in the fact that ‘a number of valid regulations [were] no longer made public.’fn10 Theoretically, it corresponded to Hitler’s dictum that ‘the total state must not know any difference between law and ethics’; fn11 because if it assumed that the valid law is identical with the ethics common to all and springing from their consciences, then there is indeed no further necessity for public decrees — location: []() ^ref-64345

constitutional questions during the period of revolutionary change, even went to the trouble of issuing an entirely new and very elaborate constitution in 1936 (‘a veil of liberal phrases and premises over the guillotine in the background’fn12), an event which was hailed in Russia and abroad as the conclusion of the revolutionary period. — location: []() ^ref-5528

have stressed the peculiar ‘shapelessness’ of the totalitarian government. fn14 Thomas Masaryk saw early that ‘the so-called Bolshevik system has never been anything but a complete absence of system’;fn15 and it is perfectly true that ‘even an expert would be driven mad if he tried to unravel the relationships between Party and State’ in the Third Reich.fn16 It has also been frequently observed that the relationship between the two sources of authority, between state and party, is one of ostensible and real authority, so that the government machine is usually pictured as the powerless façade which hides and protects the real power of the party. — location: []() ^ref-27924

The crucial point in the later development was not the conquest of the Soviets by the party, but the fact that ‘although it would have presented no difficulties, the Bolsheviks did not abolish the Soviets and used them as the decorative outward symbol of their authority.’fn26 — location: []() ^ref-3988

---
Duplication of offices and division of authority, the co-existence of real and ostensible power, are sufficient to create confusion but not to explain the ‘shapelessness’ of the whole structure. One should not forget that only a building can have a structure, but that a movement – if the word is to be taken as seriously and as literally as the Nazis meant it – can have only a direction, and that any form of legal or governmental structure can be only a handicap to a movement which is being propelled with increasing speed in a certain direction — location: []() ^ref-9988

Mostly such orders were ‘intentionally vague, and given in the expectation that their recipient would recognize the intent of the order giver, and act accordingly’;fn31 for the elite formations were by no means merely obligated to obey the orders of the Fuehrer (this was mandatory for all existing organizations anyway), but ‘to execute the will of the leadership.’fn32 And, as can be gathered from the lengthy proceedings concerning ‘excesses’ before the party courts, this was by no means one and the same thing. The only difference was that the elite formations, thanks to their special indoctrination for such purposes, had been trained to understand that certain ‘hints meant more than their mere verbal contents.’ fn33 — location: []() ^ref-1628

In other words, since knowledge of whom to obey and a comparatively permanent settlement of hierarchy would introduce an element of stability which is essentially absent from totalitarian rule, the Nazis constantly disavowed real authority whenever it had come into the open and created new instances of government compared with which the former became a shadow government – a game which obviously could go indefinitely. One of the most important technical differences between the Soviet and the National Socialist system is that Stalin, whenever he shifted the power emphasis within — location: []() ^ref-23654

his own movement from one apparatus to another, had the tendency to liquidate the apparatus together with its staff, while Hitler, in spite of his contemptuous comments on people who ‘are unable to leap across their own shadows,’fn37 was perfectly willing to continue using these shadows even though in another function — location: []() ^ref-48224

The only rule of which everybody in a totalitarian state may be sure is that the more visible government agencies are, the less power they carry, and the less is known of the existence of an institution, the more powerful it will — location: []() ^ref-35918

According to this rule, the Soviets, recognized by a written constitution as the highest authority of the state, have less power than the Bolshevik party; the Bolshevik party, which recruits its members openly and is recognized as the ruling class, has less power than the secret police. Real power begins where secrecy begins. In this respect the Nazi and the Bolshevik states were very much alike; their difference lay chiefly in the monopolization and centralization of secret police services in Himmler on one hand, and the maze of apparently unrelated and unconnected police activities in Russia on the other — location: []() ^ref-59561
