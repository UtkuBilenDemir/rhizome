# Ernesto Laclau - On Populist Reason-Verso
## Metadata
* Author: [[2005]]

## Highlights
This, as we have seen, leads to one of the demands stepping in and becoming the signifier of the whole chain — a tendentially empty signifier — location: []() ^ref-22727

---
What happens, however, if the dichotomic frontier, without disappearing, is blurred as a result of the oppressive regime itself becoming hegemonic — location: []() ^ref-63913

---
As we can see, the categories of 'empty' and 'floating' signifiers are structurally different. The first concerns the construction of a popular identity once the presence of a stable frontier is taken for granted; the second tries conceptually to apprehend the logic of the displacements of that frontier — location: []() ^ref-44678
