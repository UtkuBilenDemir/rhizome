So he imports this special breed of scorpions and feeds them on metal meal and the scorpions turned a phosphorescent blue color and sort of hummed. "Now we must find a worthy vessel," he saidSo we flush out this old goof ball artist and put the scorpion to him and he turned sort of blue and you could see he was fixed right to metalThese scorpions could travel on a radar beam and service the clients after Doc copped for the breadIt was a good thing while it lasted and the heat couldn't touch usHowever all these scorpion junkies began to glow in the dark and if they didn't score on the hour metamorphosed into scorpions straight awaySo there was a spot of bother and we had to move on disguised as young junkies on the way to LexingtonBill and Johnny we sorted out the names but they keep changing like one day I would wake up as Bill the next day as JohnnySo there we are in the train compartment shivering junk sick our eyes watering and burning — location: []() ^ref-40119

The next step was carried out in a film studioI learned to talk and think backward on all levelsThis was done by running film and sound track backward For example a picture of myself eating a full meal was reversed, from satiety back to hungerFirst the film was run at normal speed, then in slow-motionThe same procedure was extended to other physiological processes including orgasm(It was explained to me that I must put aside all sexual prudery and reticence, that sex was perhaps the heaviest anchor holding one in present time.) For three months I worked with the studioMy basic training in time travel was completed and I was now ready to train specifically for the Mayan assignment — location: []() ^ref-8661

More routine workI studied Mayan and listened to it on the tape recorder and mixed Mayan in with EnglishI made innumerable photomontages of Mayan codices and artifactsthe next step was to find a "vessel"We sifted through many candidates before settling on a young Mayan worker recently arrived from YucatanThis boy was about twenty, almost black, with the sloping forehead and curved nose of the ancient Mayans(The physical type has undergone little alteration)He was illiterateHe had a history of epilepsyHe was what mediums call a "sensitive" For another three months I worked with the boy on the tape recorder mixing his speech with mine(I was quite fluent in Mayan at this pointUnlike Aztec it is an easy language.) It was time now for "the transfer operation""I" was to be moved into the body of this young MayanThe operation is illegal and few are competent to practice itI was referred to an American doctor who had become a heavy metal addict and lost his certificate"He is the best transfer artist in the industry" I was told "For a price. — location: []() ^ref-39102

The instrument clicked like a Geiger counterThe doctor sat down and explained to me that the operation was usually performed with "the hanging technique"The patient's neck is broken and during the orgasm that results he passes into the other bodyThis method, however, was obsolete and dangerousFor the operation to succeed you must work with a pure vessel who has not been subject to parasite invasionSuch subjects are almost impossible to find in present time he stated flatlyHis cold grey eyes flicked across the young Mayan's naked body: "This subject is riddled with parasitesIf I were to employ the barbarous method used by some of my learned colleagues(nameless assholes)you would be eaten body and soul by crab parasitesMy technique is quite differentI operate with moldsYour body will remain here intact in deepfreezeOn your return, if you do return, you can have it back." He looked pointedly at my stomach sagging from sedentary city life"You could do with a stomach tuck, young manBut one thing at a timeThe transfer operation will take some weeksAnd I warn you it will be expensive. — location: []() ^ref-24557

Then he injected a blue fluid of heavy cold silence as word dust fell from demagnetized patternsFrom a remote Polar distance I could see the doctor separate the two halves of our bodies and fitting together a composite beingI came back in other flesh the lookout different, thoughts and memories of the young Mayan drifting through my brain — location: []() ^ref-60313

---
The doctor gave me a bottle of the vomiting drug which he explained was efficacious in blocking out any control wavesHe also gave me another drug which, if injected into a subject, would enable me to occupy his body for a few hours and only at night. "Don't let the sun come up on you or it's curtainszero eaten by crabAnd now there is the matter of my fee. — location: []() ^ref-63445

The paper and the embassy had warned me that I would be on my own, a thousand years from any help I had a vibrating camera gun sewed into my fly, a small tape recorder and a transistor radio concealed in a clay potI took a plane to Mérida where I set about contacting a "broker" who could put me in touch with a "time guide"Most of these socalled "brokers" are old drunken frauds and my first contact was no exceptionI had been warned to pay nothing until I was satisfied with the arrangementsI found this "broker" in a filthy hut on the outskirts surrounded by a rubbish heap of scrap iron, old bones, broken pottery and worked flintsI produced a bottle of aguardiente and the broker immediately threw down a plastic cup of the raw spirit and sat there swaying back and forth on a stool while I explained my businessHe indicated that what I wanted was extremely difficultAlso dangerous and illegalHe could get into troubleBesides I might be an informer from the Time PoliceHe would have to think about it — location: []() ^ref-47534

planting cornThe boy touched my shoulder and disappeared up the path in jungle dawn mist As I stepped forward into the clearing and addressed one of the workers, I felt the crushing weight of evil insect control forcing my thoughts and feelings into prearranged molds, squeezing my spirit in a soft invisible viseThe worker looked at me with dead eyes empty of curiosity or welcome and silently handed me a planting stickIt was not unusual for strangers to wander in out of the jungle since the whole area was ravaged by soil exhaustionSo my presence occasioned no commentI worked until sundownI was assigned to a hut by an overseer who carried a carved stick and wore an elaborate headdress indicating his rankI lay down in the hammock and immediately felt stabbing probes of telepathic interrogationI turned on the thoughts of a half-witted young IndianAfter some hours the invisible presence withdrewI had passed the first test — location: []() ^ref-29592

I found out also that the priests themselves do not understand exactly how the system works and that I undoubtedly knew more about it than they did as a result of my intensive training and studiesThe technicians who had devised the control system had died out and the present line of priests were in the position of some one who knows what buttons to push in order to set a machine in motion, but would have no idea how to fix that machine if it broke down, or to construct another if the machine were destroyedIf I could gain access to the codices and mix the sound and image track the priests would go on pressing the old buttons with unexpected resultsIn order to accomplish the purpose I prostituted myself to one of the priests(Most distasteful thing I ever stood still for)During the sex act he metamorphosed himself into a green crab from the waist up, retaining human legs and genitals that secreted a caustic erogenous slime, while a horrible stench filled the hutI was able to endure these horrible encounters by promising myself the pleasure of killing this disgusting monster when the time came And my reputation as an idiot was by now so well established that I escaped all but the most routine control measures — location: []() ^ref-34796

The priest had me transferred to janitor work in the temple where I witnessed some executions and saw the prisoners torn body and soul into writhing insect fragments by the ovens, and learned that the giant centipedes were born in the ovens from these mutilated screaming fragmentsIt was time to actUsing the drug the doctor had given me, I took over the priest's body, gained access to the room where the codices were kept, and photographed the booksEquipped now with sound and image track of the control machine I was in position to dismantle itI had only to mix the order of recordings and the order of images and the changed order would be picked up and fed back into the — location: []() ^ref-853

machineI had recordings of all agricultural operations, cutting and burning brush etc.I now correlated the recordings of burning brush with the image track of this operation, and shuffled the time so that the order to burn came late and a year's crop was lost Famine weakening control lines, I cut radio static into the control music and festival recordings together with sound and image track rebellion. "Cut word linesCut music linesSmash the control imagesSmash the control machineBurn the books Kill the priestsKill! Kill! Kill!" — location: []() ^ref-707

---
You see the priests were nothing but word and image, an old film rolling on and on with dead actorsPriests and temple guards went up in silver smoke as I blasted my way into the control room and burned the codices Earthquake tremors under my feet I got out of there fast, blocks of limestone raining all around meA great weight fell from the sky, winds of the earth whipping palm trees to the groundTidal waves rolled over the Mayan control calendar — location: []() ^ref-29832

Carl's outboard vibrated in a haze of rusty oil, bit a jagged piece out of the dugout canoe and sank, in iridescent brown water. Somewhere in the distance the muffled jelly sound of underwater dynamite: ("The natives are fishing"), howler monkeys like wind through leaves. The dugout twisted slowly and stopped, touching a ruined jetty. Carl got out with his Nordic rucksack and walked to the square on high ground. He felt a touch on his shoulder light as wind. A man in moldy grey police tunic and red flannel underwear one bare foot swollen and fibrous like old wood covered with white fungus, his eyes mahogany color flickered as the watcher moved in and out. He gasped out the word "Control" and slipped to the ground. A man in grey hospital pajamas eating handfuls of dirt and trailing green spit crawled over to Carl and pulled at his pants cuff. Another moves forward on brittle legs breaking little puffs of bone meal. His eyes lit up a stem glare went out in smell of burning metal. From all sides they came pawing hissing spitting: "Papeles," "Documentes," "Passaport — location: []() ^ref-53432

But there must be thirty of them about," said Carl. The Comandante gave him a sharp look. "They are synchronized of course. They can not see or even infer each other so all think he is only police officer on post. Their lines you sabe never cross and some of them are already…" "And some of them are already dead. This is awkward since they are not legally responsible. We try to bury them on time even if they retain intact protest reflex. Like Gonzalez the Earth Eater. We bury him three times." The Comandante held up three fingers sprouting long white tendrils. "Always he eat way out. And now if you will excuse me the soccer scores are coming in from the Capital. One must pretend an interest. — location: []() ^ref-910

The Comandante spread jelly over Carl's naked paralyzed body. The Comandante was molding a woman. Carl could feel his body draining into the woman mold. His genitals dissolving, tits swelling as the Comandante penetrated applying a few touches to face and hair(Jissom across the mud wall in the dawn sound of barking dogs and running water) Down there the Comandante going through his incantations around Carl's empty body. The body rose presenting an erection, masturbates in front of the Comandante. Penis flesh spreads through his body bursting in orgasm explosions granite cocks ejaculate lava under a black cloud boiling with monster crustaceans. Cold grey undersea eyes and hands touched Carl's body. The Comandante flipped him over with sucker hands and fastened his disk mouth to Carl's asshole. He was lying in a hammock of green hair, penis-flesh hammers bursting his body. Hairs licked his rectum, spiraling tendrils scraping pleasure centers, Carl's body emptied in orgasm after orgasm, bones lit up green through flesh dissolved into the disk mouth with a fluid plop. He quivers red now in boneless spasms, pink waves through his body at touch of the green hairs — location: []() ^ref-53174

It was a transitional period because of the Synthetics and everybody was raising some kinda awful life form in his bidet to fight the Sex EnemyThe results were not in all respects reasonable men, but the Synthetics were rolling off that line and we were getting some damned interesting types by golly blue heavy metal boys with near zero metabolism that shit once a century and then it's a slag heap and disposal problem in the worst form there is: sewage delta to a painted sky under orange gas flares, islands of garbage where green boy-girls tend human heads in chemical gardens, terminal cities under the metal word fallout like cold melted solder on walls and streets, sputtering cripples with phosphorescent metal stumpsSo we decided the blue heavy metal boys were not in all respects a good blueprint. — location: []() ^ref-14155

In the pass the muttering sickness leaped into our throats, coughing and spitting in the silver morning, frost on our bones. Most of the ape forms died there on the treeless slopes, dumb animal eyes on "me" brought the sickness from white time caves frozen in my throat to hatch in the warm steamlands spitting song of scarlet bursts in egg flesh, beyond the pass, limestone slopes down into a high green savanna and the grass-wind on our genitals, came to a swamp fed by hot springs and mountain ice. and fell in flesh heaps, sick apes spitting blood laugh, sound bubbling in throats torn with the talk sickness, faces and bodies covered with pus foam, animal hair thru the purple sex-flesh, sick sound twisted thru body, underwater music bubbling in blood beds, human faces tentative flicker in and out of focus. We waded into the warm mud-water, hair and ape flesh off in screaming strips, stood naked human bodies covered with phosphorescent green jelly, soft tentative flesh cut with ape wounds, peeling other genitals, fingers and tongues rubbing off the jelly-cover, body melting pleasure-sounds in the warm mud. till the sun went and a blue wind of silence touched human faces and hair. When we came out of the mud we had names. — location: []() ^ref-65256
