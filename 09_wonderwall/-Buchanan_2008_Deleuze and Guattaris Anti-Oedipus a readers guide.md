They were particularly opposed to the Left Bank Maoism that blossomed that spring like the proverbial hundredflowers.They rejected the idea that May '68 constituted a first or preliminary stage in a longer struggle that would culminate in the installation of a new state apparatus.27 Tt would be strange', Guattari remarked, 'to rely on a party or state apparatus for the liberation of desire.'

-Oedipus is a May '68 book providing it is understood that Deleuze and Guattari were not 'soixante-huitards' or May 68ers and that their view of those events was quite different from the students and workers who put up barricades in the streets and tore up paving stones in search of the beach underneath. Their reticence regarding May '68 can partially be explained in generational terms inasmuch that Deleuze and Guattari saw themselves as belonging to the generation prior to the actual 68ers (if by that one means the students at the Sorbonne who provided the initial spark of protest that set the politically seismic events in motion — location: []() ^ref-36569

hose who evaluated things in macropolitical terms understood nothing of the event because something unaccountable was escaping.

Liberated desire means desire that escapes the impasse of private fantasy: it is not a question of adapting it, socialising it, disciplining it, but of plugging it in in such a way that its process not be interrupted in the social body, and that its expression be collective.

There can be no denying that Anti-Oedipus is conceived as a revolutionary book, i.e., a book that wants to open our eyes to the potential for revolution in the realm of everyday life. But as the passage just cited makes clear, its definition of revolution doesn't include taking power.29 It doesn't mean overturning one regime and then installing another regime and reforming government from top to bottom as the Maoists and Leninists demand. It wants no part of such programmes — location: []() ^ref-11957

Where will the revolution come from?' From start to finish, Anti-Oedipus is dominated by this single question: Will it come in the person of a Castro, an Arab, a Black Panther, or a Chinaman on the horizon? A May '68, a home-grown Maoist planted like an anchorite on a factory smoke-stack? Always the addition of an axiom to seal off a breach that has been discovered; fascist colonels start reading Mao, we won't be fooled again; Castro has become impossible, even in relation to himself; vacuoles are isolated, ghettos created; unions are appealed to for help; the most sinister forms of 'dissuasion' are invented; the repression of interest is reinforced - but where will the new irruption of desire come from? (AO, 413/454) — location: []() ^ref-28724

Desire is revolutionary in itself, Deleuze and Guattari argue, but it is constantly being shackled to, or worse converted into interest, and as interest it is susceptible to capture, domestication and pacification. Their conviction, reiterated throughout Anti-Oedipus, is that 'capitalist society can endure many manifestations of interest, but not one manifestation of desire, which would be enough to make its fundamental structures explode, even at the kindergarten level.' (AO, 414/455). But pure manifestations of desire are rare, even in actual revolutionary situations. — location: []() ^ref-27133

Daniel Guerin has said some profound things about the revolution of 1789. The bourgeoisie never had any illusions about who its real enemy was. Its real enemy was not the previous system, but what escaped the previous system's control, and what the bourgeoisie strove to master in its turn. It too owed its power to the ruin of the old system, but this power could only be exercised insofar as it opposed everything else that in rebellion against the old system. The bourgeoisie has never been revolutionary. It simply made sure others pulled off the revolution for it. It manipulated, channelled, and repressed an enormous popular desire.

There was, for instance, broad acceptance of the idea that power is not a simple matter of coercion or repression, the dominance of one group of people over another.

Anti-Oedipus was lobbed into this fray like an intellectual cluster bomb - it had multiple targets, from the primacy of the signifier in linguistics to the dependency on lack in psychoanalysis, but its primary objective was (as Michel Foucault astutely points out in his highly influential preface to the English translation) to caution us against the fascist inside, the desire to seize power for oneself. The principal thesis of Anti-Oedipus, around which its many conceptual inventions turn, is that revolution is not primarily or even necessarily a matter of taking power. Insofar as taking power means preserving all the old institutions and ideas in which power is invested it could even be said that revolutions of this type are actually counter-revolutionary in purpose and intent because they change nothing essential. By the same token, Deleuze and Guattari were concerned about the allure of power, its apparent ability to drive us to desire to be placed under its yoke. — location: []() ^ref-22219

Ironically, the American-led reconstruction of Baghdad has proceeded much less efficiently and effectively than did Saddam Hussein's regime following the first Gulf War.5 When faced with such egregious examples of the (mis-)use of power, it is, as Deleuze puts it, perfectly obvious who exploits, who profits, and who governs (DI, 212/296).

as simply fashion and the endless parade of apparently radical, new forms of chic.8 In spite of itself, the culture of dissent turned out to serve the interests of the very thing it was protesting against, namely the archly conservative order of global capitalism. The conclusion Deleuze and Guattari draw from this is not, however, the gloomy idea at the heart of 'cynical reason' (Sloterdijk) that capital always triumphs and therefore nothing can be done to change things. On the contrary, they conclude that capitalism's very facility for unleashing and containing change means that it is tapping into a highly unstable energy source, namely desire, which in their view is revolutionary by nature, and is therefore extremely vulnerable.9 — location: []() ^ref-11386

Therefore it is impossible to maintain that desiringproduction is another word for id.

an author is great because he cannot prevent himself from tracing flows and causing them to circulate, flows that split asunder the catholic and despotic signifier of his work, and that necessarily nourish a revolutionary machine on the horizon. That's what style is, or rather the absence of style - asyntactic, agrammatical: the moment when language is no longer defined by what it says, even less by what makes it a signifying thing, but what it causes it to move, to flow, and to explode - desire. For literature is like schizophrenia: a process and not a goal, a production and not an expression. (AO, 145/158-9 — location: []() ^ref-7810

Every writer is a sellout. The only literature is that which places an explosive device in its package, fabricating a counterfeit currency, causing the superego and its form of expression to explode, as well as the market value of its form of content.' (AO, 146/160). It is not by accident that Deleuze and Guattari's one collaborative book specifically on literature, namely their book on Kafka, focuses on a writer who famously published virtually nothing in his own lifetime.18 In published work, particularly in the case of successful authors like F. Scott Fitzgerald, another author Deleuze and Guattari very much admire, it becomes too difficult to separate out desire from the sticky entanglements of interest — location: []() ^ref-8666

Freud interprets Schreber's 'becomingwoman', his feeling that he must become a woman because the Order of Things requires him to do so for the salvation of the world, as an expression of his ambivalent feelings for his father, which according to the Oedipal model are a supposed to be a combination of resentment and supplication — location: []() ^ref-4584

---
in doing so, he neglects the political and historical content of Schreber's delusion, reducing it all down to Oedipal metaphors (AO, 64/66; 98/107) — location: []() ^ref-60977

---
The psychoanalyst tells us that the father is important precisely because Schreber doesn't talk about him. We reply that we have never seen a schizophrenic delirium that is not firstly about race, racism, politics, that does not begin in all directions from history, that does not involve culture, that does not speak of continents, kingdoms, and so forth. We state that the problem of delirium is not connected to the family, and concerns the father and mother only in a very secondary way, if it concerns them at all. (CY, 80) — location: []() ^ref-35687

---
The schizophrenic 'suffers' from 'too much reality' in the sense that this experience can be and often is both painful and distressing; but they also 'suffer' from 'too much reality' in the technical sense that the experience is completely involuntary (CY, 86). This feeling, usually referred to in psychiatric and psychoanalytic discourse as 'psychosis', in which the impossible and the possible have fused into one continuous reality, is the clinical basis of Deleuze and Guattari's entire project (DI, 234/326) — location: []() ^ref-65292

---
The principal goal of Anti-Oedipus was to achieve a theoretical rapprochement between psychoanalysis and Marxism in order to create a new method of critical analysis (one better suited to the tenor of the times, as they saw things) which the authors provocatively refer to as either 'materialist psychiatry' or 'schizoanalysis' (the terms are used interchangeably). To achieve this goal, it had to accomplish two things: 1. introduce desire into the conceptual mechanism used to understand social production and reproduction, making it part of the very infrastructure of daily life; 2. introduce the notion of production into the concept of desire, thus removing the artificial boundary separating the machinations of desire from the realities of history — location: []() ^ref-31225

Deleuze and Guattari do not say schizophrenia is everywhere; rather what they say is that desiringproduction is everywhere, but it is only visible to us in its raw state in schizophrenic delirium.

The problem here is twofold: psychoanalysis cannot account for 'the satisfaction the handyman [bricoleur] experiences when he plugs something into an electrical socket' (AO, 8/13) except in sexual terms, which it rules out; nor can it see the sexuality evident in the peculiar pleasure the bureaucrat takes in creating a well-ordered universe offilesand reports, spreadsheets and databases, that he creates for himself, except as a perversion — location: []() ^ref-41545

The truth is that sexuality is everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on.

Deleuze and Guattari repolarize it around an affirmative notion of production, setting aside the standard negative notion of desire as lack or need. On Deleuze and Guattari's view of things, desire does not need to be stimulated by an exogenous force such as need or want, it is a stimulus in its own right. This brings us to the key proposition advanced by this chapter, which as we'll see in more detail in the discussion of the fourth chapter of Anti-Oedipus is in fact one of the four principal theses of schizoanalysis: Deleuze and Guattari propose that every investment of desire is social. — location: []() ^ref-16913

The basic problem facing the philosophy of immanence is this: how can the mind constitute itself without first of all having an idea of itself?10 The answer is that it cannot do so unless, as both the Kantian and Hegelian traditions do, it first of all posits a prior and necessarily higher category capable of comprehending it, such as the Mind or the Spirit. Deleuze's solution, which goes in the reverse direction to Kant and Hegel, is to posit at a foundational level a set of passive syntheses that are constitutive without being active. These syntheses have no self-comprehension of what they are doing, much less an end or goal - they simply act, as unthinkingly as machines.11 There is a necessary circularity here: the syntheses produce everything, even themselves. Chaos, Deleuze's definition of nothingness, is the passive syntheses turning in a void, ceaselessly operating, but not producing anything — location: []() ^ref-43062

Habits are the 'presents' (moments of pure lived time) the imagination seizes from theflowof time, without ever ceasing to be temporal. Passive synthesis, then, is not just a capacity to receive sensation, as Kant might have it, but implies a synthetic ability to constitute the sensate organism as well. There are two levels of habit, or what Deleuze also calls 'constituent passivity': organic synthesis and perceptual synthesis — location: []() ^ref-60207

sensitivity to light, sense of smell, penetrating mouth (ATP, 283/314). As Deleuze himself acknowledges, many people will not recognize the foregoing as belonging to the order of habit because there doesn't seem to be any action or activity in the processes related to contraction. This owes, he says, to a psychological illusion and a fetish for activity which misunderstands the very process of learning itself because it fails to grasp that contemplation is not the activity of a self, but the passive synthesis of what we mistake for a self. Deleuze rejects the a priori assumption that the self is an integrated global whole (the psychoanalytic theory of the fractured subject is in his view a complicated variant on this assumption). He takes the view, rather, that behind the fagade of the self which acts are little selves which contemplate and which render possible both the action and the active subject. We speak of our 'self only in virtue of these thousands of little witnesses which contemplate within us: it is always a third party who says 'me'.

Marx's general formula of capital (MCM') can therefore be interpreted as depicting not just the logic of individual capitalist investments, but also a recurrent pattern of historical capitalism as a world system. The central aspect of this pattern is the alternation of epochs of material expansion (MC phases of capital accumulation) with phases of financial rebirth and expansion (CM').14 In the first phase, money capital 'sets in motion' a vast range of activities, but centres principally on converting raw materials into finished commodities, and derives its impetus to growth from the sale of these manufactured objects. In the second phase, however, this money capital, having achieved a critical mass, basically 'sets itself free' from its dependency on objects and expands through exclusively financial deals in banking, insurance, derivatives, bond trading and lately the exploitation of intellectual property. — location: []() ^ref-4170

---
The three syntheses of desire correspond to the three phases in Marx's general formula of capital, namely MCM': the synthesis of connection is the 'free labour' or 'primitive accumulation' phase that sets everything in motion; the synthesis of disjunction corresponds to the intermediate phase of investment in industry (input-output combinations); and the synthesis of conjunction is the third phase in which money capital is set free all over again. This model is, however, very far from describing a steady-state system — location: []() ^ref-50367

Translating this back into economic theory, what Deleuze and Guattari are effectively saying is that the process of primitive accumulation produces as a by-product something not only greater than itself, but something that ultimately triumphs over it, arrogating to itself all of the latter's productive power.

Psychoanalysis treats the subject as though they were perpetually 'sick from their childhood'. But even more tellingly, psychoanalysis assumes that in our childhood it is only the family that matters to us, that in effect we only have eyes for mummy and daddy, as though all our games, dreams and fantasies revolve around nothing but the shuttered-in trinity of mummy-daddy-me. But as they point out, children are surely not unaware of the fact that daddy 'has a boss who is not father's father, or moreover that [their] father himself is a boss who is not a father' (AO, 106/115) — location: []() ^ref-4415

And thus we come to the fourth paralogism of fictitious desire. 'The law tells us: You will not marry your mother, and you will not kill your father. And we docile subjects say to ourselves: so that's what I wanted.' (AO, 125/136 — location: []() ^ref-2361

---
By placing the distorting mirror of incest before desire (that's what you wanted, isn't it?), desire is shamed, stupefied, it is placed in a situation without exit, it is easily persuaded to deny 'itself in the name of the more important interests of civilisation (what if everyone did the same, what if everyone married his mother or kept his sister for himself?

Freud puts Oedipus before culture, before history; every child, regardless of sex, irrespective of where or when they are born, despite all differences of culture, religion, ethnicity, race, class, education and parenting, must resolve their desire to replace mummy or daddy (depending on sex) in their relation with the parent of the opposite sex.

Jaws is basically a western - it has all the requisite generic elements: isolated small town dependent on the nature for its prosperity (in this case the sea as a tourist attraction), competing interests amongst the townsfolk, a disaffected but expert sheriff, and a threatening outsider. The story unfolds and climaxes exactly as you would expect of a western. My point is that the shark, fully as much as the demonized Native Americans in actual westerns, is not meaningful in itself; it is a mechanism whose purpose is to bring about a connective synthesis. It is, however, an illegitimate synthesis because it determines in advance what its final form should be and passes judgement on all who come before it in the name of that final form. Insofar as the narrative constantly points to the lack of 'community spirit', the failure to act collectively for the common good, as the true cause of the disaster that unfolds, it imposes that sense of 'precocious totality' mentioned above which has the invidious effect of making individuals caught up in its current feel incomplete.39 — location: []() ^ref-33639

But this isn't sufficient, he also needs a human adversary for his transformation to be complete, which is where the ominous homme de ressentiment Gentleman Brown fits into the picture. His is that pure form of evil against which even the feeblest attempt to strike a blow can be construed as positive. Instructively enough, Conrad calls Brown 'a blind accomplice of the Dark Powers', thereby exposing his narratological role as well as his inner character.49 He is needed to compel Jim to act, to finally put the welfare of others before his own and redeem himself. In other words, both Jim and Gentleman Brown mark out regions on the body without organs called 'honour' which through the world-weary mouthpiece of Marlow the text constantly calls on us to treat in an exclusive and restrictive way, as though they were not indeed both products of the same impulse, namely the desire to submerge knowledge of the structural transformation of daily life by the agencies of capitalism beneath a reassuringly chivalric story about the deeds of individuals. And it is imputed, too, that we as readers are too full of ressentiment ourselves to appreciate the real majesty of Jim's achievements.50 The schizophrenic reading, then, the one that brings about the dialectical reversal I mentioned, is the one that treats the gap between Jim and Brown as a nondecomposable space and their relationship as inclusive and non-restrictive — location: []() ^ref-33830

This history of social machines has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is an account of the coming into being of capitalism; on the other hand, it is a genealogy of the contemporary structure of desire.

Social machines are statistically constituted and follow a law of large numbers (AO, 316/342). What do Deleuze and Guattari mean by this?

Essentially what Deleuze and Guattari are arguing here is this: the movement of microscopic entities combines to produce macroscopic entities which in turn react on those same microscopic entities, forcing them to adapt and change. As a simple example of this, one can look at the notions of the crowd, herd or swarm: all three are composed of x number of individual beings who by themselves act quite differently to how they act in a group. To put it another way, the behaviour of the individual components of these three forms taken on their own is not a reliable indicator of the behaviour of the crowd, herd or swarm.

---
And as will be seen in more detail in what follows this is exactly the way Deleuze and Guattari narrate the history of the formation of capitalism. Deleuze and Guattari's hypothesis, which structures their entire account of the genealogy of social forms is this: capitalism was known to the primitive peoples as that which would destroy their society and their rituals were designed to preserve them from this menace. 'If capitalism is the universal truth, it is so in the sense that makes capitalism the negative of all social formations.' (AO, 168/180). Thus the two regimes preceding capitalism, the territorial machine and the despotic machine, can be understood as 'negations of negations' (to use Hegel's concept) in that their structures are designed to inhibit the irruption of capitalism's free-flowing flows — location: []() ^ref-25845

---
This hypothesis has three components. First, it assumes that desire is essentially gregarious in nature, inasmuch that as humans we seem driven to want to live in groups. Deleuze and Guattari arrive at this point in a classically dialectical manner, namely via what Hegel referred to as the path of the negative (via negativa). If desire was not gregarious, not part of the very infrastructure of society, then, they reason, we could not explain how it is possible for people to fight for their own oppression. But, by the same token, desire is not bonding, it may bring a group together but it will not necessarily enable the group to endure. Man is in this sense simultaneously Homo natura and Homo historia. This is the second assumption: desire has to be trained or disciplined to produce lasting collectivities (AO, 208/227). For this reason, all social formations prior to capitalism viewed theflowsof desire as dangerous and — location: []() ^ref-50740

---
This is the third assumption: desire is socialized by codification (i.e., the attribution of meaning). Women, children, herds, seed, sperm, shit, menstrual blood and so on are transformed into gifts from God, or given some other symbolic value and thereby given a social function they did not previously have. This is what coding is at its most basic. When Deleuze and Guattari say we should not ask about the meaning of something, they are referring only to the operations of the unconscious. Beyond that, as we saw above, they take exactly the opposite view: we must inquire about meaning, but in a functional rather than semiotic sense. What we have to decipher is the social purpose behind the encoding of every aspect of daily life from the most mundane and the sheerly biological to the complex and metaphysical — location: []() ^ref-8694

The earth is the body without organs on a social scale - it is in effect the body without organs of all the bodies without organs of all the individual subjects in any given society. Communities are formed in the same way as subjects: an aggregate of syntheses gives rise to a 'whole' that acts retroactively on the syntheses to yield an entity qualitatively different from its component parts. That entity is then enjoyed or consumed for itself. Deleuze and Guattari's thesis is that communities can be formed in this way because subjects are formed in this way. By the same token, subjects can be formed in this way because communities are. This is what is meant by their thesis that desire forms part of the infrastructure of society — location: []() ^ref-6122

---
So, how does the territorial machine work? First of all it has to capture desire and compel it to change function. There isn't a single or universal repressing agent, Deleuze and Guattari insist, but rather an affinity or co-efficiency between desiring-machines and social machines (AO, 201/217). The medium through which this affinity or co-efficiency works is the system of representation, which takes hold of and represses the 'germinal influx' that is desire's representative. — location: []() ^ref-61202

emblematic, is put forward as a lure to conceal the true form of desire. 'It matters little that this image is "impossible": it does its work from the moment that desire lets itself be caught as though by the impossible itself. You see, that is what you wanted!' (AO, 178/191). The three parts of the system then are: (1) germinal influx as the representative of desire; (2) the prohibition against this representative of desire is the repressing representation; (3) while thefigureof the transgressor is the displaced representative (AO, 180-1/193). — location: []() ^ref-55467

This prohibition depicted sex outside of the marriage as deleterious to the well-being of both the individual and society itself inasmuch as it was deemed to promote lasciviousness and a cavalier attitude towards relationships. But as is obvious enough, it is the prohibition itself that creates the possibility of 'sex before marriage', which in this sense is equivalent to incest. The point is that the very desire called 'sex before marriage' is created by the prohibition so as to be dishonoured, and does not in this sense represent real desire. It is a displacement of real desire which as Deleuze and Guattari tirelessly argue knows neither persons nor names. — location: []() ^ref-36395

Translated, this means the state unleashes market forces (i.e., decodedflows),that exceed its grasp in all directions, its ability to overcode in other words, and this process eventually leads to an inversion of the relation between the sovereign and the system he heads. At the supreme point of the development of this process of inversion, the state is transformed into a mechanism of business. But even as its real power diminishes, the state reinvents itself as a 'moral authority'.

This dualism at the heart of the capitalist system has its own inner dynamic which Marx himself diagnozed as the tendency towards a falling rate of profit. Capitalist investment is constantly coming up against this problem. No matter how profitable an investment initially is, the rate of profit-making inevitably declines over time. In a housing boom, to take a relatively simple example, prices might rise by as much as 100 per cent in the space of a year, effectively doubling the cost of houses, which is an astonishing rate of profit-making. If a house cost $100,000 at the start of the year, it would be worth $200,000 by the year's end. If the same rate of profit-making were to continue, it would be worth $400,000 at the end of the second year, and so on. Tied as it is to a host of external factors, including the cost of borrowing money, the relative cost of real estate elsewhere, the real growth in wages, and so on, this rate of profit-making rarely lasts more than a year or so in the housing market, which is why such moments are referred to as 'booms'. They are short-lasting and powerful in effect, but ultimately unsustainable. Smart property investors know this and are constantly on the look-out for the next boom as a way of maintaining the rate of profit-making. On a larger scale, manufacturing has been exported from the First World to the Third World for the same reason: to maintain the rate of profit. It is much cheaper to manufacture goods in the low wage regions of the Third World, but those cost savings are rarely passed onto the consumer. More usually they are passed directly to the company directors and shareholders in the form of dividends and an enhanced capitalization of their stock. The tendency towards a falling rate of profit is a continually recurring 'crisis' for capitalism, but not one it has any interest in overcoming. In fact, it is the principal motor powering the system, giving it its restless energy. This is what Deleuze and Guattari mean when they say the system only works by breaking down. — location: []() ^ref-63650

But in spite of its willingness to change, even if that means destroying tradition, capitalism is essentially conservative in its outlook. It only embraces innovation when it is profitable to do so.

has two main characteristics, which atfirstglance might appear contradictory: on the one hand, it stimulates (over-)production via a radical process of decoding; but on the other hand it retards that production by insinuating anti-production into every level of society. As we have seen, the primitive territorial machine established the social unit by coding theflowsof desire, by giving them a meaning; the despotic machine loosened these codes up, but also bonded them to its own regime by overcoding them. It emptied the codes of their sacred content and at the same time spiritualized them, making them part of what defined 'good society'. Thus to use our previous example, if sex before marriage was prohibited in primitive society because it offended the gods, then in the despotic regime it was prohibited because it threatened the smooth transfer of capital (e.g., children born out of wedlock could not inherit property). Capitalist decoding evacuates the meaning out of all codes, that is to say all the rules, regulations, laws, codes of conduct, and so forth, rendering them completely arbitrary, or rather purely functional. Decoding in this context doesn't mean interpretation or deciphering, it literally means taking the code away. Taking their place is the axiomatic.65 'Why not merely say that capitalism replaces one code with another, that it carries into effect a new type of coding?' (AO, 268/294).

In the modern state, these relations apply to money. In this situation, 'the family becomes a microcosm, suited to expressing what it no longer dominates' (AO, 286/315).

The Oedipal triangle is the personal and private territoriality that corresponds to all of capitalism's efforts at social reterritorialisation.' (AO, 289/317). Its purpose is to neutralize the threat of schizophrenia, the modern capitalist machine's absolute limit, by creating an interior limit to the movement of desire that pulls it up short of the exterior limit (i.e., schizophrenia) — location: []() ^ref-13567

But, they say, psychoanalysis draws two false conclusions from this initial premise. First, that the agency in question can be discerned on the flipside of the displaced represented; and second, that this agency is a nonrepresented representative (or 'lack') obtruding in the sphere of representation — location: []() ^ref-26150

Here, though, Deleuze and Guattari show that it is the concepts of deterritorialization and reterritorialization that offer the most effective tools for this purpose. The basic premise of this pair of concepts is this: 'The movement of deterritorialisation can never be grasped in itself, one can only grasp its indices in relation to the territorial representations.' (AO, 347/377). These indices are desiring-machines, which can take a variety of forms - an airplane, a train, a bicycle, sewing machine, or whatever. The one caveat is that it must not be a person. 'Psychoanalysis, with its Oedipal stubbornness, has only a dim understanding of this; for one reterritorialises on persons and surroundings, but one deterritorialises on machines.'

Sexuality cannot be liberated if it does not first of all dismantle the mechanism of sexual difference. Deleuze and Guattari's position regarding sexuality is radical in its simplicity. Sexual difference would not exist, they argue, if it did not serve the interest of power. Culturally we only observe and indeed obsess about the biological differences between the sexes because it is in our social interest to do so. Sexual difference is a means by which power exerts itself. The point is that sexual liberation, whether of women or men, or homosexuals, transsexuals, and so on, is not achieved by extending 'rights' of enjoyment to all interested parties, but by working to extinguish the factor of interest altogether. One has to get rid of both the problem and the solution — location: []() ^ref-3063

-Oedipus concludes by mapping out four theses that in sum characterize the schizoanalytic project as a whole: 1. Every libidinal investment of the unconscious is social and bears upon a sociohistorical field (AO, 375/409). 2. There are two types of social investments: there is the unconscious libidinal investment of the group or desire and the preconscious investment of class or interest (AO, 377/411). 3. The non-familial libidinal investments of the unconscious have primacy over the familial investments of the unconscious (AO, 390/427) — location: []() ^ref-13468

I know that the paper money in my wallet is really worthless, but all the same I act as though it is not; I know Santa doesn't really exist, but all the same I act as though he does; I have no way of knowing if my bank details really are secure, but all the same I act as though they are. Adapting Donald Rumsfeld in an essay on the Abu-ghraib scandal, Zizek referred to this disavowed knowledge as 'the "unknown knowns", things we don't know that we know, which is precisely the Freudian unconscious, the "knowledge which doesn't know itself", as Lacan used to say' — location: []() ^ref-31442

If a vote for either party is a vote for business, then that vote is really an instance of what Zizek calls 'forced choice': in the US, and most of the West today, you can vote Left or Right, but you cannot vote against business. The exception to this rule might seem to be the Green parties that have risen to prominence in most Western nations, though not in the US, in the past two decades. But a vote for the Greens isn't a vote against business or capital, it is a vote for the consolation of an environmentally friendly business — location: []() ^ref-24535

Either government must let business go to the wall and accept the consequences, or it must assume full responsibility for the business by taking it over. Neither is a politically acceptable option today. So, if we are to do more than scoff at an electorate for failing to see that it isn't acting in its own best interest by continuing its rightward swerve, then we need to understand why this swerve appears to be the correct choice under the conditions in which it must be made — location: []() ^ref-35897

Here the commitment to Labour that is an essential plank of Leftist parties actually gets in the way of the larger commitment to 'guaranteed life' because it puts the Left in the position of having to be, among other things, anti-immigration so as to defend wage levels from erosion due to the importation of cheap 'foreign' labour. In Australia, it was the Labor Party that inaugurated the 'White Australia' policy for precisely this reason. It mobilized xenophobia to create a protected labour market. Cynicism doesn't explain our situation because it doesn't provide a complicated enough account of how the electorate actually thinks and functions. Neither does false consciousness. What's needed is an analysis that shows how desire and interest can travel in different and indeed conflicting directions. Cynicism short-circuits the properly schizoanalytical contradiction the separation of desire and interest allows us to formulate and makes it seem as though it is possible to accommodate it. And that is precisely what schizoanalytical criticism should not allow: its purpose is exactly the opposite - to constantly point up the unendurability of the present. — location: []() ^ref-25100

False consciousness' and cynicism are conjured to explain the demoralizing fact that in spite of a century and more of consciousness-raising by the Left (in all its manifestations) after which no one could be left in any doubt as to the true nature of capitalist society, a spontaneous shift towards an equitable form of socialism has not only not occurred, but the minimal tokens of that Utopia (such as the minimum wage, the public health system, old-age pension, and so on) are under threat of extinction. It is the schism between knowledge ('I know capitalism is an inequitable system') and action ('but all the same'), or lack thereof, as the case may be, that false consciousness and cynicism attempt to explain. They reason that if we knew the truth about our situation we would be compelled to act, therefore the fact that we do not act must mean we have disavowed the truth either by suppressing all knowledge of it from ourselves or by choosing not to acknowledge its implications. What we must prevent at all costs is cynicism becoming this new truth that is always already out there, because if that happens political thought, not to mention political action, is finished. The problem today is that while citizens as consumers can be motivated to complain or change brands, it is all but impossible to persuade them to act. Cynicism doesn't explain this state of affairs, it excuses it. In this sense, cynicism is the new name for what Foucault called fascism, as such Anti-Oedipus' message is as vital and urgent today as it was when it was first published. — location: []() ^ref-36055

, these three factors combined to produce a national explosion of Deleuzism: a brace of young scholars from the backblocks of Australia (among them, Rosi Braidotti, Anna Gibbs, Meaghan Morris, Stephen Muecke and Paul Patton) were drawn to France in the 1970s by the sense that something intellectually important was happening there, something more exciting than was available to them at home. After spending a year or more in Paris studying with Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard and others, these scholars returned home and radicalized the Australian academy, making it a veritable hotbed of theory. — location: []() ^ref-51973

Anti-Oedipus reinvigorates the concept of class struggle by linking it to desire and thus confronting the issue of how class solidarity comes about in the first place, or, as is more often the case fails to do so in spite of apparent need. If there is a binary in Anti-Oedipus it is between the concepts of desire and interest, which Deleuze and Guattari oppose in their account of the desire for oppression — location: []() ^ref-61800

What Anti-Oedipus asks us to do, ultimately, is examine ourselves and understand our own inertia in the face of an egregious social system.

That said, I would recommend the following selections from Deleuze's work: chapter 2 of Difference andRepetition, which details Deleuze's theory of passive synthesis; chapter 13 of The Logic of Sense, which is an account of Artaud's notion of the body without organs; chapter 5 of Empiricism and Subjectivity, which gives an account of the notion that relations are external to their terms; and lastly chapter 3 of Nietzsche and Philosophy on critique. As would be obvious from this book, Deleuze and Guattari's interviews, given and published in the years after Anti-Oedipus appeared, are also extremely helpful. So one should certainly also look at Dialogues and Negotiations — location: []() ^ref-46993
