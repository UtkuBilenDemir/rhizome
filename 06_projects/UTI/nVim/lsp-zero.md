[Github-page](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)

don't forget you install lang servers with mason on this one with the following command

## TODO

- Do you want to have pictograms on the auto-completion window? [lsp-kind](https://github.com/onsails/lspkind.nvim)
- Couldn't find a good solution to directly auto-expand on selection
