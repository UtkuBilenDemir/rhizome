## Motivation & Concept
> other definitions stress the role of SI in building workable ‘utopias’. For Gilles deleuze, for example, SI takes place through windows of opportunity for social creativity along lines of life, lines of imagination, lines of bringing in assets for a better future. all these are windows of opportunity for social creativity which may emerge from challenges to institutional practices. Innovation often emerges from conflict: opportunity spaces at micro scales may make creative strategies possible at macro scales. here, we already see the announcement of the very important relationship between the initiatives of individuals and groups in small communities, and its logic of continuation in the construction and facilitation of institutions that could enable socially creative strategies at macro/micro scales.

-- Moulaert et al


- As Moulaert further argues, SI is always concerned with the human condition and directed against social exclusion. Therefore, one cannot separate SI from its socio-political context (see ibid. 17 )
- In the same manner, researching SI establishes a democratic participation format in itself. Building transdisciplinary research is already a democratic action to improve human condition.
- The roots of the protest culture started transdisciplinary with worker/student solidarity. 
- SI is not a tool to save or solve the global crisis of welfare state nor it is the saviour of liberal democratic cycle. 

> This is why it so important to focus on the role of SI in developing alternative socio-political discourses and on its potential for social change in particular contexts. In any case, SI as a principle, as a slogan.

-- ibid. 18


**What are the exclusionary and alienating dynamics of the economic system against which SI is reacting? What dynamics feed into the improvement of the human condition? What social or political movements are of relevance for social change? What socio-political dynamics and institutional transformations are needed in order to make SI a success in the streets, the local communities, the enterprises?**



> We believe that the concept is best understood and mobilized in the context of a sociological heritage that challenges conventional economic approaches to development, and that has at its heart a desire for emancipatory macro-social change. new directions in SI analysis, a field of expanding diversity, are set within this general framing, which we see as the basis for building a more comprehensive metatheoretical framework that can host the many partial theories, methodologies and practices that characterize and enrich SI.

> whether social innovation should be seen as a contained potential within a hostile overarching socio-economic environment, or a political Trojan horse that can be universally transgressive, when social and political conditions allow wider mobilisation.

-- hillier


> Gilles Deleuze’s empiricist philosophy, however, offers a view of associationalism, which could be useful. In his work with Fe ́ lix Guattari (1987), Deleuze seeks immanent, micrological conditions of interactive transformation capable of resisting appropriation by major power structures. Deleuze and Guattari ‘look for immanent modes of association in pragmatic assemblages that are capable of inventing alternative forms of social interaction’

We are not trying to identify organic intellectuals but we are trying to cultivate organic intellectualism through a participative research process.


**According Deleuze**

> The world is emerging: whenever people act creatively, they change the world and therewith themselves’. The usefulness of this methodology to a rapidly changing research field is clear: it is an emancipatory approach that responds creatively to change as the central hallmark of life. It thus has much in common with the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze,

## High Level Objectives
1. To identify 
## Preliminary Activity Structure


## Questions to myself
!. Are the socially innovative activism transferable? Can we re-use succesful (and alternative participation forms)
