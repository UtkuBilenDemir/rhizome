## Job Offer

*Part-time research assistant in a Horizon Europe project*

**Position:** Research assistant  
**Duration:** [Bitte einfÃ¼llen (300 Stunden? Also, ein bisschen Ã¼ber 2 PMs? Hatten wir hier nicht mehrere PMs? Timeframe?)]  
**Working time:** part-time  [Richtig?] 
**Company:** ZSI GmbH
**Department:** Research Policy & Development

ZSI is a private non-profit institute for applied social sciences and a Centre of Excellece for social innovation based in Vienna (Austria).
ZSI implements research and application projects on the social embedding and impact of all types of innovations and contributes to the design and diffusion of socially accepted and sustainable innovations to meet global challenges.

We are looking for a research assistant to support our team at the *Research Policy & Development* department in the project [PROJECT_NAME]. [PROJECT_NAME] is specifically focusing on understanding the scope, extent and current trends of EU-China research cooperation. Our responsibilities in the project correspond to a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the co-patents and co-publications between China and EU countries. 

### Tasks
- **Co-patent analysis**;
	- will be based on PCT patent data received from the European Patent Officeâ€™s (EPO) PATSTAT database,
	- and along with the patent output, will also assess the patterns of international cooperation in patent application output between China and EU Member States.

- **Co-publication analysis**;
	- will be based on the data gathered from the global citation database Web of Science (WoS) for jointly authored scientific works of Chinese and EU organisations between 2012 and the most recent year with relatively complete publication data (most likely 2020),
	- the individual publications will be (re-)categorised according to the Science-Metrix ontology under three classification levels (scientific domain, field, and sub-field) after the data collection, and normalisation process,
	- the results will be visualised including but not restricted to
		- development in the number of co-publications over the years,
		- collaboration patterns (network visualisations),
		- most visibly involved organisations and countries,
		- and co-publication numbers over time under each of the most visible scientific domains, fields, and sub-fields.

The results and analysis of both analyses are to be collected under a unified report. 

### Expected experience
- [Do we have a degree policy?]
- Experience in quantitative research methods
- Experience with R (beneficial to be familiar with visualisation libraries like ggplot2, plotly, and the like as well as with RMarkdown), or Python (in case Python is the only language, familiarity with pandas module is required; familiarity with vis. modules like plotly, seaborn, bokeh etc. as well as with Jupyter Notebooks is beneficial)
- Academic level oral and written communication skills in English (German is not a requirement)

**Beneficial to have**
- Experience with git and online git hosts like GitHub, GitLab etc.
- Familiarity with project management tools, with KANBAN boards
- Familiarity with citation databases like Web of Science, SCOPUS etc.
- Familiarity with LaTeX, Markdown, (if R is the preferred language) RMarkdown, (if Python is preferred) Jupyter Notebooks
- Familiarity with Linux distributions
- [To be able to pronounce Chinese region/university names, you will be asked who Sun-Yat Sen is]

### What do we offer?
- [MONEY, how much?]
- Occasional home-office days
- Collaboration-ready and [sometimes even] friendly team [working 7/24]
- In-depth consultation into the EU-project implementation
- Consultation regarding any kind of SSH-related topic or the tasks listed above
- [MARXIST_THEORY]




section excellence:Â Special attention will go out to EU-China research cooperation byÂ **analysing co-patents and co-publications**. TheÂ **co-patenting analysis**Â will be based on PCT patent data received from the European Patent Officeâ€™s (EPO) PATSTAT database for the last 10 years available in the latest version. PCT applications are generally better for international comparison than national applications as the procedures are standardised. This analysis will not only characterise the patent output, but also assess the patterns of international cooperation in patent application output between China and EU Member States, thus also upgrading knowledge on the specialisation and cooperation patterns with their potential legal and regulatory implications. TheÂ **co-publication analysis**Â will be based on the data gathered from the global citation database Web of Science (WoS) for jointly authored scientific works of Chinese and EU organisations between 2012 and 2021 (or the latest available date). The relevant data will be extracted, normalised and categorized based on Science-Metrix Ontology, providing input for at least three classification levels, i.e., scientific domains, fields and sub-fields. At these three levels, the copublication will give insights in the developments over time, the collaboration patterns, the most visibly involved countries and institutions.



section implementation:Â **task 1.1. EU-China research cooperation (co-patent/co-publication analysis) â€“ (Leader: ZSI, Members: IN, IFRI,IAI, UTURKU)**

T1.1 aims to better understand the scope, extent and current trends of EU-China research cooperation focused on big data and related research topics, among others data mining, data analytics, cloud computing, machine learning, databases and algorythms. The ST&I cooperation between China and EU Member States in this area falls into the â€˜problematicâ€™ category concerning data privacy and security and related legal clauses even though China has made big leaps forward in recent times with the introduction of its Data Security Law or Security Protection Regulations on Critical Information Infrastructure.  
T1.1 will work toward 2 policy briefs with regard to (1) ST&I co-operation areas (and non-areas) related to big data and (2) current patterns, drivers, barriers and challenges, as well as future co-operation options between China and EU in the big data-related scientific fields. It is foreseen that some of the data on which the two policy briefs will be elaborated will feed into the official website (WP6) as visualised content. In order to directly network and engage with stakeholders, the policy recommendations will be bundled in summaries per year (D1.5) and presented at the conference organized in T.5.3. Posts on these topics will be made on the projectâ€™s website (T6.1) as well as articles for written media in order to reach a wider audience, pique interest and generate discussion among the broader public.

zum finanziellen/zum fahrplan:

ich habe gestern die kalkulation fÃ¼r das projekt an gorazd geschickt. so, wie es jetzt im planungsheet steht, wÃ¤re stand der dinge, dass die person ca. 300h zur verfÃ¼gung hat. ich habe vorerst mit utkus stundensatz (utku war ja eigentlich fÃ¼r die aufgabe angedacht) kalkuliert (+8% inflation).Â   

anderweitige beschÃ¤ftigungen fÃ¼r die person innerhalb anderer projekte am zsi hÃ¤ngen dann nicht von uns ab :)  

wenn ich mich richtig erinnere, haben wir im rahmen unseres meetings einen arbeitsbeginn ab 2023 vorgesehen: das deliverable 1.1 ist in M10 fÃ¤llig, also das wÃ¤re ende august 2023.Â
