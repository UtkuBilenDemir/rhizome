# BIO4Campus
- [ ] Try to run a querry looking for the specific names of the faculties/institutions in University of Belgrade's namespace on WOS
	- [ ] This might clutter the dataset a little too much, maybe getting the filtered names of the institutions and looking for them int the univ. of belgrade dataset is a better option
