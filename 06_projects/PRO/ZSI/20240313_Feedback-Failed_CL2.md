# 20240313_Feedback-Failed_CL2
This whole operation was mainly started when you indicated you would like to do a project together

I have brought you the calls and showed my dedication despite being in Karenz

## J
- The project is quickly became yours
- It was acted like there was an idea already
- It was immediately heard
- Even at the end the implication was vaguely communicated

## R
- I like the open communication 
- However, you have a quite false assumption about my ambition and dedication for basically anything I give my word for
- only reason I played along with it was that I thought it was helping you to build some equivalence between us
- The conception you can manage G seems to be a false interpretation. You likely deceive yourself with the idea you are steering anything, it seems more like you are operating on whatever is decided with the comfortable illusion of being a part of the decision process.

At the end, you guys are no fit to deal with the social situation in the org, nor to deal with G. R might think he is good at it but just giving him whatever attitude he likes is not dealing with him. 

There is nothing personal, and no hard feelings. This is a feedback to you.
