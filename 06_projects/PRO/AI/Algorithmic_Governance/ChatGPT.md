If I would show you my thesis, would you proof read and even enhance it, or make suggestions?
 As an AI language model, I'd be happy to help you proofread and offer suggestions for improvement on your thesis. Keep in mind, though, that my knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which goes up to September 2021. If your thesis is on a subject that has evolved significantly since then, my suggestions might not be completely up-to-date. To get started, you can share some portions of your thesis, and I'll do my best to provide feedback and suggestions. However, please remember that I am an AI and not a human expert in your field, so you should always double-check my suggestions with trusted sources and consult with your academic advisor or other experts as appropriate.

can I upload a pdf here?

I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I cannot directly interact with files such as PDFs. However, you can copy and paste the text from your thesis into our conversation, and I'd be glad to help with proofreading and offering suggestions for improvement. Please keep in mind that there might be limitations on the length of the text you can paste at one time, so you may need to share it in smaller sections.

what do you understand when I say: Algorithmic Governance in post-disciplinary societies?

When you say "Algorithmic Governance in post-disciplinary societies," it suggests the use of algorithmic systems, such as AI and machine learning, to manage and regulate various aspects of society. This concept involves the idea that algorithms can be used to make decisions or provide guidance on a wide range of topics, from resource allocation to policy implementation.

The term "post-disciplinary societies" typically refers to a shift away from traditional disciplinary structures and approaches, such as rigid hierarchies and specialized knowledge domains. In this context, it may imply a more fluid, dynamic, and interconnected approach to governance, where various disciplines and fields of knowledge are integrated to solve complex societal issues.

Overall, the phrase suggests a future where algorithms play a significant role in governing societies that have evolved beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries, potentially leading to more efficient and effective decision-making processes. However, this concept also raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential biases in the algorithms used for governance.

do you see a specific relation between this and Deleuze's Postscript on Societies of Control?

Yes, there is a connection between the concept of Algorithmic Governance in post-disciplinary societies and Gilles Deleuze's "Postscript on the Societies of Control." In this seminal work, Deleuze proposes that societies are transitioning from disciplinary societies, as described by Michel Foucault, to societies of control.

Disciplinary societies are characterized by confinement and the strict segmentation of spaces, such as factories, schools, and prisons, where individuals are disciplined and normalized. In contrast, societies of control are characterized by continuous, decentralized, and flexible forms of power that extend beyond specific institutions and permeate various aspects of life.

Algorithmic governance in post-disciplinary societies could be seen as a manifestation of Deleuze's societies of control. The use of algorithms and AI for decision-making and regulation represents a shift away from the centralized, hierarchical structures typical of disciplinary societies. Instead, these technologies enable a more fluid and continuous form of control that can adapt to different situations and rapidly changing environments.

In this context, algorithmic governance could be seen as both enabling and being enabled by the move toward societies of control. However, it is important to note that this development also raises questions about surveillance, privacy, and the potential for manipulation or abuse of power, as well as concerns about the transparency and accountability of the algorithms themselves.

how would you connect these to the core works of Deleuze and Guattari in the context of Rhizome?

Deleuze and Guattari introduced the concept of the rhizome in their collaborative work "A Thousand Plateaus." The rhizome is a metaphor borrowed from biology, referring to an underground root system that grows horizontally without a central point, connecting plants in a network. In the context of philosophy and social theory, the rhizome represents a non-hierarchical, fluid, and decentralized way of thinking, organization, and knowledge production.

Connecting the concepts of algorithmic governance in post-disciplinary societies, societies of control, and the rhizome, we can see some common themes:

1.  Decentralization and non-hierarchical structures: Both the rhizome and societies of control emphasize the importance of decentralization and the shift away from strict hierarchies. Algorithmic governance in post-disciplinary societies also embodies this idea, as decisions and regulations are increasingly determined by interconnected algorithms rather than centralized authorities.
    
2.  Fluidity and adaptability: The rhizome, as a metaphor, represents a dynamic and adaptable system that can grow and change as needed. Algorithmic governance and societies of control exhibit similar qualities, as they emphasize flexibility and the capacity to respond to rapidly changing environments.
    
3.  Interconnectivity and multiplicity: The rhizome is characterized by its interconnectedness and the way it allows for multiple, non-linear connections. Similarly, algorithmic governance and societies of control involve a high degree of interconnectivity across various domains, fields, and technologies.
    
4.  Transversality: Both Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the rhizome and the idea of algorithmic governance in post-disciplinary societies advocate for a transversal approach that cuts across traditional boundaries and disciplines, fostering collaboration and the sharing of knowledge.

In summary, algorithmic governance in post-disciplinary societies can be seen as an extension of the ideas presented by Deleuze and Guattari in their work on the rhizome and societies of control. Algorithmic systems embody the rhizomatic principles of decentralization, fluidity, interconnectivity, and transversality, which may lead to new forms of organization, decision-making, and knowledge production. However, it is crucial to be aware of the potential challenges and concerns related to surveillance, privacy, and the ethics of algorithmic decision-making.
