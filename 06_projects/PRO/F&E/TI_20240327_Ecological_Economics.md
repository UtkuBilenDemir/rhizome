Marxist economics are not a zero sum game.

Quite the contrary, according to marx, our whole political-economic existense is created by the labours introduction into the nature.

The purpose of Marx' diagramm is to illustrate how capital flows, that flow is  in a closed system, it doesn't mean the production is also entrapped in that.

Are you claiming to know how much matter is in the universe.x

So, exactly like the physicians tell us. In order to say first rule of thermodynamics claims we can only create limited amount of things, you have to be able to know what the extend of the natural resources are.

You mean we just have to introduce low energy from outside to keep entropy at bay? That's called maintanence

There is no planet B?

you know the waste can be a part of an ecosystem

First completely good statement. And our problem is that we are looking to only a small stripe in time in our political-economical status quo. We should be able to find a methodology to make it a priority for econmics to put sustainability into the centre.


3 Points:

1. Marx
2. Thermo 1 (maddenin korunumu)
3. Thermo 2 (you need to introduce low entropy to hold entropy at bay )
