AI: Having a workshop in March will be too tight, April is more feasible. We would like to offer people to build their own models with model trainer, so we need to keep an eye on the development there. This approach was discussed with Jero.

NTTDATA is to support the workshop(s) in March to increase the interactive aspects.
