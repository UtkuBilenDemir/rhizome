- There is no foreseen prolongation right now. 
The LLs are expecting a prolongation because 8-10 months won't be enough to produce something meaningful considering the delays.

Even if there is a prolongation, it probably will be a few months.

Understanding SDGs is the key to the IntelComp tools, without getting insight about them it is hard to understand the importance of the tools.

There is a workshop idea produced in the exchanges between WP6-WP7 Leads:

Productionwise, we are still not far enough for LLs to answer the *hard questions* at the workshops. We have to deliver LLs the substance to present the USPs of the IntelComp tools.

Added value of IntelComp is not the data or the ML-services but the best USP of IntelComp is the integration of all of these services.
