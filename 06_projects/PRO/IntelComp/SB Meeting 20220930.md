# [[IntelComp]] SBM Meeting 20220930
created: 2022-09-29 23:57

What did the LLs do meanwhile:

- LLs were trying to build a common approach to recruit specific kinds of stakeholder groups. The main stakheolders of IntelComp are **Policymakers/-analysts** but  we also focused on stakeholders from private sector, society, and academia
- **Some of the LLs had already scheduled workshops** with the stakeholders but they had to postpone those events. LLs had to first see the developments in the STI Viewer and clarify some questions about the data coverage.
- We have, especially as WP6 Lead, **participated in the considerations for the STI-Viewer design**. 
- We also had some alignment meetings with other work packages in the last couple of weeks. **We had a meeting with WP4** about the development of STI-Viewer, we had a **couple of meetings with WP7**  collaborate in a workshop to improve and also simulate the workshop design in the living labs, we also had a **meeting with WP1** since the second round of policy questions and the 3. round of the data sources are on the run right now.
- We have a couple of workshops before us. First there is an STI-Viewer demonstration LL will be getting, and then since we will be done with the stakeholder recruitment campaign a workshop about the design of the LL-Workshops. We have also an anticipated workshop with the involvement of WP7 simulate the LL workshop designs in a TestDrive workshop close to the end of October.
- LLs have scheduled workshops for the end of October but there might be another delay considering the delay in the development.

to super clarify: datasets + indicators that are LL specific come from WP1/WP6 collaboration //// user stories (i.e. how these are visualized) + functionality feedback come from WP4/WP6 collaboration
