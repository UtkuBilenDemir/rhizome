# [[IntelComp]] WP6-Weekly 
created: 2022-06-02 10:02

3 tasks assigned to the LLs was mentioned before, LL-Health will be presenting their *homework* results.

How do we complete the stakeholder mapping.

It is disccussed that someone from the technical teams to join WP6 Meeting,

potentially with Jero, Joseba to build a more robust communication because we losing too much time.

LL-Climate: maybe a meeting in June or July with Haris and others to build alignment.

#### Discussion about LL-Health contributions

Use cases are complex, 

how can IntelComp communicate it to the stakeholders


Planned trainings would help the workshops starting with workshop4 but for workshop 2 we need to analyse the content of the available data.

LLs already defined the policy questions the topic now is the extent of the data. 

LL-Health is not sure about the content of the data.

As Joseba confirmed to bring more insight to the data. Stakeholder can make their own minds up, our duty is to give them as much insight as possible.

What the stakeholders can expect from the products is the most essential part.

#### Discussion about the LL building blocks


The keypoints shown on the MiroBoard to addressed in D6.1. The outline to how we can implement content regarding each of the building blocks:
  
1.  Executive summary (1-2 pages)
2.  Introduction (1-3 pages)
3.  Methodology (max. 5 pages)
4.  Overall goals (2-3 pages)
5.  Challenges and strengths (3-4 pages)
6.  Indididual LL (max. 60 pages total)
7.  Goals (1-2 pages)
8.  Policy questions and data facilitation (max. 5 pages)
9.  Stakeholders (max. 8 pages)
10.  Alignment with technical development (2-3 pages)
11.  Roadmap (3-5 pages)
12.  Conclusion (max 4. pages)
13.  Annex (references, stakeholder lists, etc.)

With regards to continiuity is the activities/meetings in WP6 are in theirselves a co-creation process.

The key principles mentioned in the LL-illustration indicate also our operation structure, we will be circling 


We will enter the outline into a collaborative document for everyone to enter their contributions. We need keep the length of the document in control, considering the number of elements we need to address the file can expand exponentially.

The responsibilities of each LL will be indicated on the outline presented on MiroBoard. 

Policy questions do not have to be as extensive as identified for WP1. 

Policy questions for stakeholders or policy questions might stakeholders potentially have? -> The policy question that can be answered by [[IntelComp]].

What can we provide for policymakers:

- Data
- Evaluation

What connects WP6-WP1-WP2

We can also include other partners who have PMs in WP6. We can definitely invite them especially regarding their expertise. 

Defining stakeholders in 8 Pages will be challenging but 

The deadline for the D6.1. is the 17.06. We have a lot of thinking done and LLs have already content for most of the sections. It is basically compilation work right now. WP1-WP2 will be delivering the last version of the policy questions.

Preparatory LLs? -> Definitely helpful, LLs need to decide if it is efficient with consideration of their own budgets.

A google drive document is to be prepared according to the presented D6.1. format. 


Roadmap: describing the elements entered into the timelines on the Miroboard and linking those to the relevant elements.

We could name **stakeholders** as **targeted stakeholders** to indicate it is just the prepatory work.

Monitoring guidelines should be added to the outline

**Stakeholders** section is more for reasoning for the selected stakeholder groups and generally stakeholder mapping/engagement strategy. 

Alignment with technincal development: How do you plan to contribute to the development side?

How to go beyond the national scope as LL-Health stated.

Other LLs to read LL-Climate's document

Use the content from the MiroBoard, we have already addressed all of the building blocks there.
