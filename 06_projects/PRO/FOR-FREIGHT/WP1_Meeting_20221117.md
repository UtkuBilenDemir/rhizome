- There are still missing contributions from specific partners regarding D1.1. ZSI is not among them.

- We will be contacted in the following weeks (read asap) about our role
- Clarifications about the deliverable guidelines
	- Be clear about what the deliverable offers to other deliverables (if any)
	- If there are other partners contributing, be clear about their tasks and the nature of their contributions
- Next meeting on 01.12 10:00-11:00 (might be changed because it is a holiday in Romania)
