Dear {{partner}},

I hope everything is going well for you since we saw each other in Athens.

After analysing the doodle poll entries, it became clear that a common workshop session for all of the use cases is not feasible as there would be too many missing partners. Therefore we decided to introduce 3 different sessions instead.

Please let me know which one of the options you find better.

Best!
Utku.
