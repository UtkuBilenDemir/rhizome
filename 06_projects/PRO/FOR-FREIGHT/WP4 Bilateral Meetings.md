# WP4 Bilateral Meetings
created: 2023-06-15 16:22

https://www.iconetproject.eu/consortium/

## Outline

- Discussion of best practices for reaching stakeholders in the T&L area.
- Suggestions for specific stakeholders to contact (also with consideration of any useful information from the T4.1 Questionnaire, as well as D1.1, and D1.2)
- Discussion about T5.3, including:
	+ Its connection with T4.3,
	+ Potential approaches for training,
	+ Any updates regarding the use cases.

## Questions

We have a spreadsheet where we enter the stakeholder organisations. We enter both possible stakeholders in and outside of our consortium. We also try to indicate their relevance to the each use case 

- First of all, **do you have any suggestions** to where to look at for stakeholders. You also had collaboration with other projects especially under ICT-53, are there stakeholders which were not a part of FOR-FREIGHT or mentioned in any of the deliverables so far we should take into consideration

> Athens Airport: they have


- **How to reach other (let's say secondary) stakeholders** like carriers/truck/van drivers, final customers, port authorities, customs etc. since we decided to be comprehensive with our stakeholder engagement. 
- How **can we measure the effectiveness** of our stakeholder engagement?

- Do we want to communicate the impact of this **project to the public as well**?

- A little bit hard to tell about who might be the customers of each use case would be. We mostly approximate through the D1.2, D4.2 does not say too much about the stakeholders as it is now. **May we count on you to react on the spreadshee**t when we release it next week?

- How do you see the advances **in the use cases right now.** Because our plan is, when we engage the stakeholders in T4.3, also build the pathway to the training 
	- What is the situation with the **Romanian use case**, is it disclosed already?
	- When do you think the use cases will be **mature enough for us to also prepare the training phase**?
- How is it going with the **community building**



## KPIs
### **Use Case #1**: Spain
#### From GA
The goal of **Scenario 1** is to optimize connection vessel / truck of containerized import traffics managed by CSLS by improving port operations and transport to DHL facilities.

i) Improve information flow (real time data exchange and document digitalization), 
ii) Improve truck planning and truck staying at the port and terminal and 
iii) Reduce traffic congestion at the port, therefore improve environmental impact, in terms of pollutant emission reduction.

- Improve forecast planning by >15%
- Increase document digitalization by >20%
- Reduce container staying at the port by >15%
- Reduce GHG emissions by >15%



**Scenario 2** will focus on the use of more efficient, sustainable, faster and safer transport mode in the last mile distribution focus on the existing Metro network.

i) Faster distributions through the existing nodes, 
ii) More sustainable transport mode: we will use the existing metro lines with less emissions and transport cost compared to the current distribution mode, 
iii) Reduction of traffic congestion and 
iv) A safer transport mode as metro is safer than road transport

- Reduction of transport times from DHL warehouse to final destination by >10%
- Reduction of External Cost [25] (Environmental impact + Social Cost) by > 80%
- Reduction of operational costs >12%

#### Policy relevance (D1.2)
1)     Facilitate an increase in the share of rail, short sea shipping and inland waterways in view of a more sustainable modal composition of the transport system through infrastructure improvement
2)     Foster multimodality and interoperability between the TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) transport modes and better integrating the urban nodes into the network.
3)     Increase the resilience of TEN-T to climate change and other natural hazards or human-made disasters and support climate-neutrality by integrating the costs of greenhouse gas emissions in the cost-benefit analysis
4)     Improving the efficiency of the TEN-T governance tools

### Use Case #2: Greece
#### From GA

The FOR-FREIGHT solution to be implemented in the logistics chain between the Piraeus port and the AIA, will target to create an innovative solution which will integrate information from the legacy individual management systems of all the involved stakeholders, the field-equipment/devices of their personnel and additional information and intelligence provided by newly deployed sensors, devices and Machine Learning (ML) and data analytics functions, and will support the end-to-end multimodal logistics process by providing to logistics operators and end-users , the overall real-time, end-to-end picture of the logistics process.

- Reduction of the container idle time at the port by 25%
- Reduction of the container idle time at the airport by 25%
- Reduction of the customs clearance process time by 20%
- Reduction of errors by 20%
- Increased efficiency of the storage space by 15%
- Increased end-to-end capacity due to optimization of resource utilization by 20%



### **Use Case #1**: Romania
#### From GA

Galati port is an entry point for large maritime traffic from the Black Sea to mainland Europe and is part of the REN-Danube TEN-T corridor. It is the largest port on the Danube and the second largest port in Romania. Many national and international companies operate here in the field of shipbuilding, maritime and river construction, transport of consumer goods, agricultural products, cereals, ores and metallurgical products.

- Reduction of the container idle time by 25%
- Reduction of routing errors by 20%
- Reduction of accidents by 30%
- Increased end-to-end capacity due to optimization of resource utilization by 20%
- Decrease loading/unloading time by 20%
