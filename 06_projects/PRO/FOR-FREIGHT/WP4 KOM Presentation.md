Thank you **X** ! Good morning everyone, we made it to the WP4. 

WP4 is responsible of **Commercialisation & Innovation** in the project. The WP is lead by ZSI, centre for social innovation.

Me Utku Demir and Dietmar Lampert are the ones participating in the kickoff meeting from ZSI.

The presentation structure is loyal to the template, however the order is a little different. I will be jumping after the WP outline and objectives to the individual tasks and talk about partners and partner roles after that. Finally there is risks and dependencies on the WP level.

What meant under commercialisation and innovation is in general **creating novel business models for open integrated and cooperative T&L (Transport and Logistics) services**. WP4 is also responsible of building **a roadmap, a basis for the further engagement of existing and future T&L stakeholders**. 

The objective 4 of the project sums up the responsibilities pretty well. As addition  to the ones I have mentioned 
**establishment of a comprehensive data governance framework**, and **the analysis of socio-economic and environmental impact of the proposed FOR-FREIGHT solutions**.

WP4's anticipations can be broken down into 5 main objectives

1. **Maximising business, social, and economic impact** is a central objective. It is heavily built on the stakeholder analysis and following stakeholder events. The goal here is to increase the commercial & social impact by understanding and including different stakeholder groups. Since the stakeholder engagement is one of the building blocks of the FOR-FREIGHT, these activities will be continuing for the greatest part of the projecz.

2. **WP4's management responsibilities also include the coordination of FOR-FREIGHT's intellectual property and filing for patents**. To build an intellectual property structure in the project is one of the objectives of WP4. In this context FOR-FREIGHT is striving to produce at least 2 patents.

3. As we are trying to do with the stakeholder analysis and engagement **establishing a feedback loop between the development and outer world** is an important part of the co-creation process. Such a feedback loop will be also established by 2 commercial outreach efforts. This additional feedback loop is important **to ensure market calibration and market relevance**. 

4. Then of course **establishing Business Plan and Commercialisation Strategy** is a central part of the WP4, it will be tackled firstly in the first task of the work package. Along with following the best practices of market and business opportunity and licensing analyses, analysis methods like PESTEL, SWOT, and OBM (Osterwalder Business Model) will be applied to create a robust business plan and commercialisation strategy.

5. Last but not least, **data storing & data management** is also a responsibility of WP4. This objective is mostly encapsulated in T4.4 and its respective deliverable with the task lead of TIC4.0. Of course, as FOR-FREIGHT strives for a diverse stakeholder engagement the consideration of this multidimensional stakeholder environment is important and also challenging. Other thank data data storing & management strategy will be following GDPR compliance & FAIR data principles in order to create a secure strategy with the prioritisation of personal data protection.

Now, we have an WP Outline here. WP4's timeline is spanning from the beginning to end of the project. This is an important aspect because more often than not WPs including stakeholder mapping and engagement start either too late or do not span long enough to be effective in the project. 

I also have the task and deliverable structure here but there is an illustration for these parts on the next slide therefore I'm skipping this slide.

Here is the timeline of the WP4. As you see, we have 4 tasks in the WP. 

**Task 4.1** is responsible of the **market analysis, business plan, and sustainability**. This task is led by [[BEIA]] and the task continues in 2 distinct periods in the project, at the beginning and at the end for about one year each.  

**Task 4.2** will be led by CERTH which is including Innovation & IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) activities.

**Task 4.3** is responsible for socio-economic & environmental impact generation, the task lead is ZSI. Both of the tasks 4.2 and 4.3 in Month 7 and continue until the beginning of the last month of FOR-FREIGHT.

As I mentioned previously **Task 4.4** Data Management & Governance is led by TIC4.0 and spanning on the whole duration of the project. 

The first deliverable **D4.1** is mostly relying on T4.1 and T4.4 and again led by TIC4.0.  It encapsulates the first version of the **Business & Data Management Plan**. It is to be delivered at the end of the first year of the project.

After that, we have **D4.2** which is responsible of delivering the initial plan to maximise of socio-economic, environmental impact. The responsible for the deliverable is ZSI in close collaboration with the work done in T4.2.

Finally the **D4.3** Final report on **business plan, Data Management Plan, impact generation and innovation** which will be prepared under the conjoint responsiblity of BEIA and CERTH. It is to be delivered at the end of the project and should encapsulate the fruits of the WP4, therefore all of the tasks are heavily involved in the preparation of this deliverable.

Now, we are coming to the descriptions of the individual tasks. I will briefly ask the task leads if they would like to present their own parts but it is not a necessity, I can also continue myself. 

The first task is task 4.1. Would someone from BEIA present the main points?
Ok, I'll just continue. 

As I said this task is spanning over 2 distinct periods at the beginning and at the end of the project. A very important objective for the project as this task is responsible of ensuring market relevance and R&D calibration. Also the fruits of T4.1 labor will conclude important parts of 2 deliverables in the work package.
