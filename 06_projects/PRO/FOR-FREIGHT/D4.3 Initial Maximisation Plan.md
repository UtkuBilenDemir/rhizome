## 50% Review/Revision

- [x] #todo Relevance of impact to project objectives should be clear and reported in the file (GA, p.109). The same goes for the Impact KPIs – you haven’t reported the Table in the GA (p.143) anywhere in the file. Firstly you report what is expected in the project, and then the results to explain what is achieved. ⏳ 2024-01-17 ✅ 2024-02-05

An analysis by ChatGPT:

Comparing the stakeholder groups from the Spanish, Greek, and Romanian Use Cases in the FOR-FREIGHT project reveals both similarities and differences:

Similarities:

1. All three groups include government entities and port authorities, underlining the importance of regulatory and logistical aspects in the T&L sector.
2. Each group emphasizes the role of academic and research institutions, highlighting the significance of expertise and knowledge dissemination.
3. Environmental organizations are represented in each case, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainability across the T&L sector.

Differences:

1. The Spanish UC uniquely includes IoT tech companies and standardisation bodies, focusing on cutting-edge technology and industry compliance.
2. The Greek UC stands out for its inclusion of a wide range of commercial entities like e-commerce businesses, retailers, and manufacturers, indicating a broader commercial focus.
3. The Romanian UC distinctively includes specific local entities like Danubius University and civil society organizations like Tehnopol Association, showing a strong local and community-oriented approach.

These observations suggest that while there are overarching common themes across the UCs, each one tailors its stakeholder engagement to its specific regional and sectoral needs and strengths.
