### Gaussian Elimination
>[!info]- How to
> You can perform three operations on matrices in order to eliminate variables in a system of linear equations:
> 
> - **You can multiply any row by a constant (other than zero).**
>     
>     ![image0.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370665.image0.png)
>     
>     multiplies row three by –2 to give you a new row three.
>     
> - **You can switch any two rows.**
>     
>     ![image1.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370666.image1.png)
>     
>     swaps rows one and two.
>     
> - **You can add two rows together.**

>     adds rows one and two and writes it in row two.
>     
> 
> You can even perform more than one operation. You can multiply a row by a constant and then add it to another row to change that row. For example, you can multiply row one by 3 and then add that to row two to create a new row two:

>[!info]- Row Echelon Form
>Consider the following augmented matrix:

> Now take a look at the goals of Gaussian elimination in order to complete the following steps to solve this matrix:
> 1. Complete the first goal: to get 1 in the upper-left corner.
>     
>     You already have it!
>     
> 2. Complete the second goal: to get 0s underneath the 1 in the first column.
>     
>     You need to use the combo of two matrix operations together here. Here's what you should ask: "What do I need to add to row two to make a 2 become a 0?" The answer is –2.
>     
>     This step can be achieved by multiplying the first row by –2 and adding the resulting row to the second row. In other words, you perform the operation

>     which produces this new row:
>     
>     1. (–2 –4 –6 : 14) + (2 –3 –5 : 9) = (0 –7 –11: 23)
>         
>     
>     You now have this matrix:
>     
>     ![image6.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370671.image6.png)
>     
> 3. In the third row, get a 0 under the 1.
>     
>     To do this step, you need the operation

>     ![image7.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370672.image7.png)
>     
>     With this calculation, you should now have the following matrix:
>     
>     ![image8.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370673.image8.png)
>     
> 4. Get a 1 in the second row, second column.
>     
>     To do this step, you need to multiply by a constant; in other words, multiply row two by the appropriate reciprocal:
>     
>     ![image9.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370674.image9.png)
>     
>     This calculation produces a new second row:
>     
>     ![image10.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370675.image10.png)
>     
> 5. Get a 0 under the 1 you created in row two.
>     
>     Back to the good old combo operation for the third row:

>     ![image12.png](https://www.dummies.com/wp-content/uploads/370677.image12.png)
>     
> 6. Get another 1, this time in the third row, third column.
>     
>     Multiply the third row by the reciprocal of the coefficient to get a 1:

> You now have a matrix in row echelon form, which gives you the solutions when you use back substitution (the last row implies that 0_x_ + 0_y_ + 1_z_ = 4, or _z_ = –4). However, if you want to know how to get this matrix into reduced row echelon form to find the solutions, follow these steps:
