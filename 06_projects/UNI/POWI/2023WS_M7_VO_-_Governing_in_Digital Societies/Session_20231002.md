# Unit_1

## Aim of the lecture

resources and political decisions
regarding infrastructures and
access hinder or aid mechanisms
of inclusion.
2. Possibilities of participating in and
shaping digital societies for the

## Research

- RQ: How can telemedical care be used to continue or improve
quality of medical care in Viennese nursing homes during
the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond?
- Meth.: Multi-perspectival study in nine nursing
homes in Vienna
	- Problem-centered, multi-perspective qualitative
Interviews
	- Nursing home management
	- Nurses & head nurses
	- Nursing home doctors
	- Interviews conducted live and over Zoom / phone
	- Grounded theory analysis
	- Limitation: no patient interviews
- Results: 
	-Upside:
Physicians‘ expertise is readily
available; medical care in nursing
homes can be secured (beyond
pandemic with physicians‘ retirements
etc.)
	- Downsides:
Loss of personal contact; loss of time
and more work (for some)
	- High willingness to cooperate and seek
solutions is key
