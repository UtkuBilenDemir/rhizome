Freud comprehends libidinal potential as something that has to be abandoned for the sake of the progress of civilization.18 Freud's noted pessimism leads him to ac knowledge repression as a necessary condition for the growth of the civilized society. Therefore, he cannot avoid the politically conservative consequences of his position and the skepticism toward any emancipating imperative. It is a significant predicament of the Freudian psychology of the personality that the (supposed healthy)

### Definition Nomos & Physis
The basic concept that applies to the human psyche is the radical imagination. This concept expresses the innate and independent character of the psyche. Nevertheless, for Castoriadis an absolute physis without nomos is inconceivable.2

### Radical Imaginary

This ability of psychic independence enables a kind of ‘resistance’ to social assimilation. This occurs by maintaining the internal schism that produces the difference, and gives rise to the internal otherness, which is dependent on the creation of the radical imaginary (Gourgouris, 2010).

### Social Imaginary

This relation is interdependent and appears to consist in alterity. And this alteration does not appear once but frequently in one’s lifetime. The social imaginary institution is invested by the subject in order to live as a social being. However, the subject is not and will never be reducible to a whole set of instituted significations (Gourgouris, 2010).

**->** In this respect, there is not an a priori unification of the subject, but also, for Castoriadis an absolute unification in terms of erasing difference can never be totally successful.

### Psychoanalysis 

This alteration does not concern a cognitive shift but a praxis (πράξις) and poiesis (ποιείν). The particular idea follows the traditional Aristotelian precept, and aims at a transformation of what is (είναι) towards what one can become ( δύνασθαι-είναι) (Castoriadis, 1984, 13-14). This premise sets in the core essence of Castoriadis’s anthropology two attributes of the human subjectivity as such: the reflective contemplation and the volitional activity, which are defined as the essential potential of the human being.

According to Castoriadis, when someone is able to imagine something different than what-there-is, this person is able to change the object of desire. To desire something else than what-there-is liberates the imagination (Castoriadis, 1997).

One may put it as opening and expanding of the virtual in the constitution of the actual (although these would be Deleuzian terms which do not apply as such in Castoriadis.)25 Nevertheless, one needs to be cautious while examining this position, for there is a thin but concrete line that diverges this process of alteration of reality according to the principle of imagination from the neurotic inability to accept reality as such which leads to fictitious gateways.

### Institution

In the very opposite case of non-autonomous societies, what is present is perceived as if it has always been there, as if given from God. The society’s members are alienated by societal institutions, which cannot be easily “touched”, and which actually function as the primeval form of taboo of primitive society. The citizens, unaware of their capacity to change the inherited social order which was once constituted by another society, and which may have served its needs but does not anymore, become separated from customs, meanings and institutions that paradoxically continue to serve and participate in a meaningless ghostly way.

He used thus to call the western democracies of our times “democratic oligarchies” (Castoriadis, 2000, 119),

For Castoriadis, to the extent that people are not aware of their power, society as much as individuals are bound to perpetuate the unconscious chain of repression. This heteronomous state could be ruptured only by means of some kind of a revolutionary action, - an act of freedom, or an act of crea ting this freedom, and also the praxis that can take place under the conditions of the freedom which has already been created while later a broader understanding on the part of Castoriadis upon this notion would set it as creative collective political action.31

his rupture may emerge on condition that the singularity of the personal creative imagination is able to transcend the socially featured model, and become itself the beginning for the vitiation of an institution or its reformation. Such an action could obviously not emanate from agents who place society’s laws and institutions beyond question.

### Sublimation

The term sublimation was implemented by Freud aiming to reflect on the content of a healthy – that is with less implications of contradiction and suppression as possible socialization, and this content should not be confused or identified with metathesis. Ye t what Castoriadis means, when he refers to sublimation, implies an internal metamorphosis which raises two questions: the first on the final cause and the second on the way or the means of succeeding it.

### Psychoanalysis

Self-alteration as a creative self-deformation or autoalloiosis (αυτο-αλλοίωσις) emerges as an imperative within the intersubjective connection of the analyst with the person who is analysed. As far as concerns the intentions of the analyst, the supposed “scientific neutrality” is abandoned. The process is invested in the creative capacity of the analysed person, to co-activate with the analyst, and proceed to, the poietical creation of the self. The creative self-deformation in this process is reciprocal and is activated for both of them.

Priority of psychoanalytic process should be liberation from the bonds of repression - not understood in an absolute manner but as a moment to moment process, and by no means in terms of dominion upon theunconscious.
