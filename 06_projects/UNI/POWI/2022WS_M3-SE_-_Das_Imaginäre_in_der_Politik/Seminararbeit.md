### Autonomie

#### Maria Kli

Autonomy is seen as a process of self-alteration, enabled by the force of the imaginary. This process involves the ability to incorporate otherness into the self, leading to the emergence of internal otherness, which is a precondition for psychic autonomy (Page 4).

Autonomy is both a political and psychological concept. In political terms, it refers to the ability to deconstruct and transcend the established social framework that shapes the conditions of heteronomous life, a predetermined and contained form of life. In psychological terms, it refers to personal autonomy from the control applied by unconscious mechanisms, and autonomy from the imposed social norm and dominion (Page 4).

Castoriadis connects individual autonomy with social autonomy. He acknowledges the subject's singularity as a prerequisite for the social condition of collective autonomy. He also emphasizes the necessity of the subject's transformation as a political imperative (Page 4).

Castoriadis sees society as self-constituting and capable of creating its own significances, values, norms, laws, etc. Autonomous societies are expressions of people's creativity and will, aiming to constitute a common field of free action and participation. These societies demonstrate a collective awareness that they are the source of their own existence and formation (Page 16).

Autonomy in psychoanalytic terms for Castoriadis is articulated in terms of a reversal between the unfolding of conscious and unconscious processes and mental activity. It is a process of elucidation and praxis which aims to liberate from the unconscious determinism, as well as from the domination of the 'conscious' mind over the unconscious (Page 15).

#### Gezerlis

"In IIS, Castoriadis turns also to another great field of intellectual work: psychoanalysis. The author belongs to a category of thinkers that oppose Lacan’s work in this area and he turns instead to Freud’s original works for his source of material." (Page 13)

##### Autonomy

1.  ~~"Social autonomy for Castoriadis means that society posits its own laws and does this in a collective way. But Castoriadis goes even further, saying that society not only makes its own laws (knowing that it is doing so) but also recognises itself as the source of its norms. This means that we are not talking about self-institution at the social level (only), but about explicit self-institution." (Page 3)~~
    
2.  ~~"According to Castoriadis, autonomy does not consist in acting according to a law discovered in an immutable Reason and given once and for all. Furthermore, Castoriadis does not consider autonomy as an end in itself (a formal conception that can be described as ‘Kantian’). Instead, he considers autonomy as a human goal both for itself, and in order to be able to do." (Page 3)~~
    
3.  "Autonomy signifies the unlimited self-questioning about the law and its foundation as well as the capacity, in light of this interrogation, to make, to do, and to institute. Autonomy is not the work of a pre-given Reason, ==but the reflective activity of a reason creating itself in an endless movement, both as individual and social reason.==" (Page 4) 

> Is the autonomy a circular process legitimating itself? 
    
4.  "==The first implication is that individual autonomy is impossible without social autonomy and vice versa==. A society that consists of heteronomous individuals can never be autonomous. Furthermore, individual autonomy is only possible when the social individuals take a direct part in the formation and implementation of the social laws, which condition their activity." (Page 4)
    
5.  "The third implication is that the project of autonomy historically emerges in classical Greece because it is there that humans, for the first time in History, created the institutions, principally direct democracy and philosophy, which made the questioning of instituted tradition possible." (Page 5)
