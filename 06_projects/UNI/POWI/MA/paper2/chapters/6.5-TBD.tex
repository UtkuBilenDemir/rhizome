\chapter{TO BE DISTRIBUTED}


\sidenote{\textbf{CONJUNCTIVE}}

\section{Techno-Feudalism and the Coils of the Serpent}
Finding the intentions of the global corporates behind the operation of \gls{genai} models is a much less of a sophisticated analysis in comparison, but a point
we cannot possibly overlook in this discussion whatsoever.


\section{Michel Serres?}


The parasite (noise) is not just a disturbance; it can create new orders, as systems reorganize to manage it.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Political implication:
	\item Power and social relations are often mediated by parasitic flows: who interrupts, who feeds, who reorganizes.
	\item There is no pure communication or smooth system—noise is generative.

\end{itemize}

We might need noise/parasite for change in AI

\section{The role of critique?}

\begin{quote}
	Critique as a practice of stepping beyond the limits of possible  knowledge, for some, came to replace the idea that critique should establish the  limits of legitimate knowledge.

	— \cite[17]{mackenzie2021}
\end{quote}

We need the critique ability not just for us, we need the ciritique to even
change models.
