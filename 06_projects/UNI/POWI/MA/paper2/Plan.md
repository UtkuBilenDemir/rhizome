# Plan

- **Modulation of Subjectivity**

- **The social production  of subjectivity**

- [ ] Empire  is the fully realized regime of biopower [@hardt1998] 
## 1 Introduction
## 2 Theoretical Framework
### 2.1 Research Question
#### 2.1.1 Possible lines of argument
### 2.2 State of the Art
## 3 AI
### 3.1 (A second intro to AI to introduce the problematic)
AI is this and that but the meaning making introduced some other problems
### 3.2 From Symbolic Rules to Statistical Modulation: A Brief History of AI and NLP
In the beginning it was barely an inference, but symbolic rules left their places to the modulative ways of inference. They had to invent the unsupervised learning, masking, better ways at getting at an encircling model

- [x] NLP Definition
- [x] AI history

### 3.3 Artificial Neural Network (NN)
This probably not necessary but let me say it anyway in Maas fashion. We came a long way from RNNs to transformer based CNN's. Layer by layer, there is lots of anticipation and capacity here.
- [ ] Is it even necessary?
### 3.4 The Transformer Architecture: Infrastructure of Modulation
How does the meaning making functions tho? 

- [ ] [@vaswani2017]
#### 3.4.1 From Recurrent Bottlenecks to Attention-Based Modulation
Attention makes it possible to create a strong mapping between the substance of the data and further.
#### 3.4.2 Under- & Overfitting
Under and overfittting is an approach to create access to an assumed BwO. Is BwO in the data lying around to be found? Isn't it automatically inscribed human history anyway?

- [ ] Insert Deleuzean interpretation of dropout as resistance to organification (BwO)
- [ ] Reference dropout sources [@srivastava2014]
- [ ] Frame overfitting as loss of generalizability in terms of desiring-machines
#### 3.4.3 Gradient Descent: Sinking into the Manifold
#### 3.4.4 Back Propagation
### 3.5 Undistributed
### 3.6 AI as Desiring Machine
#### 3.6.1 From Pre-Training to Fine-Tuning: Modulating the Model's World
### 3.7 The COUPLING
## 4 GenAI as an Institution of Control

> [!NOTE] 
> ## 4 GenAI as an Institution of Control

### 4.2 Postscript: Updating the Societies of Control

- [ ] Enter Deleuze: modulation instead of molding; circulation instead of enclosure.

- [ ] The subject becomes dividual; control operates through infrastructure and code.

- [ ] Bring in MacKenzie & Porter’s update: totalization through distributed, continuous capture.

- [ ] State how this applies to datafied subjectivity (see Montanari, Maas).

### 4.3 GenAI as Institution

- [ ] Define: How does GenAI function institutionally? Use Brusseau (2020) and Maas (2023).

- [ ] Propose: not as bounded org, but as modular infrastructure of inscription + modulation.

- [ ] Bring in enregistrement here as the key mechanism: it captures, segments, fixes.

- [ ] Each prompt/completion is a diagrammatic act, forming patterns of response.

- [ ] State: GenAI performs institutional governance without institutional form.

### 4.4 Institutions of Desire-Management

- [ ] Transition from power to desire (Deleuze and Guattari).

- [ ] GenAI as a desiring-machine—but one integrated into a social machine that manages desire through reinforcement (RLHF), prompting, feedback loops.

- [ ] Introduce: Brusseau’s idea of predictive modulation; Galloway’s protocol.

### 4.5 Enregistrement and Subjectivation

- [ ] Go full-on here: this is where you define enregistrement in DG’s sense.

- [ ] Describe how transformer architecture renders a machinic subject.

- [ ] Use Maas’ and Montanari’s analysis.

- [ ] Conclude with: this is a process of infrastructural subjectivation.

### 4.6 Personalization and Feedback Governance

- [ ] RLHF is institutional feedback; explain why this is NOT just prediction.

- [ ] It is a modulated regime of behaviour shaping.

- [ ] Finish: GenAI institutions are machinic diagrams—protocols that construct the dividual as actionable.

### 4.1 Foucault

- [x] Groundwork: subjectivity is not pre-social; it is institutionally formed.

- [x] Institutions = disciplinary (prison, school, clinic) = visibility, norms, spatial control.

- [/] End with: the disciplinary society fabricated the subject as visible and governable.

### 4.2 Postscript: Updating the Societies of Control
- [x] Summarize Deleuze's "Postscript on the Societies of Control" [@deleuze1992a]
- [x] Distinguish disciplinary vs. control societies
- [ ] Introduce GenAI as operating through modulation, not enclosure
### 4.2 Mold & Modulation
- [/] Define modulation vs. molding clearly using Deleuze's terms
### 4.3 Institutions of Desire-Management
- [ ] Introduce Guattari's theory of institutions from *Molecular Revolution*
- [ ] Clarify desire as not individualized but assembled and modulated socially
- [ ] Connect this to how GenAI manages affective attention and engagement
### 4.4 Personalisation and Probabilistic Meaning-Making
- [ ] Explain how GenAI systems modulate subjectivity via statistical profiling
- [ ] Use dividuation as the key concept (cite [@mackenzie2021])
- [ ] Show how personalization ≠ individualization
### 4.5 Enregistrement and Subjectivation
- [ ] Introduce enregistrement properly with citation from *Anti-Oedipus* [@deleuze1983 p.12]
- [ ] Clarify it as replacement for “distribution”
- [ ] Explain model training, prompting, completions, and fine-tuning as enregistrement
- [ ] Frame GenAI as a machinic institution that enregisters the user
### 4.6 The World Model: A Neoplatonic Representation
- [ ] Explain transformer model’s abstraction as non-symbolic representation
- [ ] Connect with epistemological implications (Pasquinelli?)
#### 4.6.1 Latency
- [ ] Explain how latency mediates vector-space access to context/knowledge
### 4.7 Agency: Kafka’s Trial and the Logic of Indeterminate Governance
- [ ] Emphasize opacity of LLM governance and user inference
- [ ] Link with Kafka's logic of submission, not rebellion
- [ ] Tie into Dishon & Prinsloo if used
#### 4.7.1 Language and the Subordination to Voice
#### 4.7.2 Language in LLM
### 4.8 UNDISTRIBUTED/TBD
#### 4.8.1 Creativity: Discrete vs. Continuous
#### 4.8.2 Dividuation
### 4.9 Difference, Repetition, Singularity (Potential discussion about the need for sensory input for the genAI (LeCun?))
- [ ] Introduce LeCun’s view on sensorimotor integration and contrast with vector-based learning
- [ ] Situate singularity and embodied cognition debate
## 5 Conjunctive Synthesis and the Construction of Subjectivity
### 5.1 Consciousness
#### 5.1.1 Desire
#### 5.1.2 Schizophrenia
### 5.2 Killing of the Desire?
### 5.3 Hegemonic Representation
### 5.4 Hallucinations and Lines of Flight in Algorithmic Architectures
### 5.5 Revolutionary Possibilities?
### 5.6 Reclaiming microflows of modulation
### 5.7 Possibility of resistance within feedback infrastructures
### 5.8 Experimental subjectivity in response to AI systems
### 5.9 Creativity
### 5.10 The Elephant in the Room
### 5.11 The Body without (World-)Models
### 5.12 AI as Capitalism

## 6 Conclusion & Outlook

# Current

## Chapter 1
- Ai history, how it started
	- NLP introduced
	- AI emerged
	- Symbolic things mostly
		- First era, rigid
		- Second era, less rigid
		- Third era, slowly there
		- Fourth era, currrent
- How does AI work
	- Transformer architecture: Transformer offers some kind of rapid translation, continuity
	- Attention based modulation: Here we have the trace, meaning is just an instance
	- Under/Overfitting is how you adjust to the BwO
	- Gradient descent is creating a amplification of the stronger arguments/results
	- Backpropagation makes the system extremely feedback oriented
- AI as desiring-machine?
- From pre-training to fine-tuning: Making models directional, intentional for a specific purpose

## Chapter 2
- Foucault and disciplinary power
- Deleuze and postscript
	- What is control
	- Predictive technologies and modulation
	- bridging of technological and institutional logics
- Genai as an instution of modulation
- What role the desire plays
- Personalisation and how genai plays its role: Amoore draws attention on the non-emancipatory effect. Acceptable, real looking answers instead of truth. A rush towards predictibility. Personalisation for the reterritorialisation
- A WORLD MODEL (Language as subordination to voice could be here the counter-argument)
- LATENCY
- AGENCY: BLURRING THE BORDERS
- Language as a subordiation to voice
- Language in LLM
- Creativity discreete and continuous
- Dividuation
- Difference and Repetition

## Chapter 3

- Consciousness
- Desire
- Schizophrenia
- Killing of desire
- Hallucinations
- Revolutionary Possibilities
- Hacking
- Experimental subjectivity

## THe new plan

1. **Intro** – stakes and problem.
    
2. **Framework/Method** – how you’re going to think.
    
3. **Chapters** – deploy the theory in depth.

---

### **2. What I Propose**

Here’s a revised macro-structure that matches your intuition:

1. **Introduction**
    
    - Stakes, research question, short road map.

2. **Theoretical Framework (Lean)**
    
    - Define _subjectivation_, _modulation_, _desiring-machines_, _infrastructure_.
        
    - Show how you will **apply them to GenAI**.
        
    - Keep under **5–6 pages**.

		1. **Chapter 1: Subjectivity and the Shift from Discipline to Control**
		    
		    - History of subjectivity (structuralism → post-structuralism).
		        
		    - Foucault: enclosures and disciplinary subjectivity.
		        
		    - Deleuze: control, modulation, dividuals.
		        
		    - Hardt/Negri + Galloway/Hui on distributed power.
		        
		    - This is the **conceptual core**.

3. **Chapter 2: AI as the Infrastructure of Modulation**
    
    - Symbolic → statistical → neural → generative.
        
    - Transformer architecture as modulation machine.
        
    - Overfitting, dropout, RLHF as micro-modulations.

4. **Chapter 3: GenAI as an Institution of Control**
    
    - Enregistrement, personalization, feedback loops.
        
    - Desire-management and the production of subjectivity.
        
    - Institutional analysis: GenAI as infrastructural governance.

5. **Chapter 4: Conjunctive Synthesis & Lines of Flight**
    
    - Experimental subjectivity, resistance, micro-politics.
        
    - GenAI and capitalist realism (Kazakov, Fisher).
