# Desire
<mark class="hltr-gray">Buchanan [[@buchanan2008e]] notes that the [[(inc)Desire]] itself is revolutionary, but (and therefore) it is shackled by the power structrues:</mark>

~~> Desire is revolutionary in itself, Deleuze and Guattari argue, but it is constantly  being shackled to, or worse converted into interest, and as interest it  is susceptible to capture, domestication and pacification. Their  conviction, reiterated throughout Anti-Oedipus, is that 'capitalist  society can endure many manifestations of interest, but not one  manifestation of desire, which would be enough to make its fundamental structures explode, even at the kindergarten level.' (AO,  414/455). But pure manifestations of desire are rare, even in actual  revolutionary situations. [[@buchanan2008e]], 11~~
