# Deleuze & AI

> <mark class="hltr-gray">Human Consciousness is entirely productive
> It process links partial objects together fragmented by history into lines of rational thoughts and belief that become expressed as some whole that we kind of say in whatever we do, in arts, statements, dogmas opinionsâ€¦And this whole is made by desire. Lines of reason, lines of belief are flows of desire.
> Reality is the productive flow that connects what is fragmanented. This is the process, this is the human mind.
> **AI** prominent shift that eliminates desire. It fills all spaces with information/knowledge/data. And what are those fillings? Those are dogmas of state, science of status-quo, capital as a body without  [[Hegemonic Reproduction]]..
> Revolutionary politics loses its impetus. **All that remains is reception, the acceptance of State, Science, Capital**

<mark class="hltr-grey">I disagree, the **AI** answers desire, it claims the answer was always there. It doesn't block desire, it definitely doesn't kill desire, it rewires it, in a loop that feeds itself. 

Not that the desire doesn't want to fulfil itself, but the creative flows benefit from the desire being fluid. The subject of desire shouldn't be this well-defined in order to breed creation.</mark>
