# Hegemonic Reproduction

Reiteration of the engraved content on the internet by the large language model risks the reiteration of the hegemonic viewpoints [[@bender2021b, 610]].

> In all cases, the voices of people most likely to hew to a hegemonic viewpoint are also more likely to be retained. In the case of US and UK English, this means that white supremacist and misogynistic, ageist, etc. views are overrepresented in the training data, not only exceeding their prevalence in the general population but also setting up models trained on these datasets to further amplify biases and harms. 
> Starting with who is contributing to these Internet text collections, we see that Internet access itself is not evenly distributed, resulting in Internet data overrepresenting younger users and those from developed countries [100, 143].12 However, it’s not just the Internet as a whole that is in question, but rather specific subsamples of it. For instance, GPT-2’s training data is sourced by scraping outbound links from Reddit, and Pew Internet Research’s 2016 survey reveals 67% of Reddit users in the United States are men, and 64% between ages 18 and 29.13 Similarly, recent surveys of Wikipedians find that only 8.8–15% are women or girls [9].
> […] The net result is that a limited set of subpopulations can continue to easily add data, sharing their thoughts and developing platforms that are inclusive of their worldviews; this systemic pattern in turn worsens diversity and inclusion within Internet-based communication, creating a feedback loop that lessens the impact of data from underrepresented populations.[[@bender2021b]], 613

## Argument reinforcement through algorithmic data expansion
> Similarly, biases in an LM used in query expansion could influence search results, further exacerbating the risk of harms of the type documented by Noble in [94], where the juxtaposition of search queries and search results, when connected by negative stereotypes, reinforce those stereotypes and cause psychological harm. [[@bender2021b]], 617

Remember, we need more and more human data, it is hard to expand data with algorithmic production. It is not effective. But we cant be producing that much to keep the models creative.
