# Autopoiesis
> The concept of autopoiesis, introduced in the early 1970s by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, describes the self-sustaining nature of living systems. [[@rijos]]

> This dynamic organization constitutes the system as a concrete unity in space, perpetually recreating its own existence. [[Plane of Immanence]] extend this concept by emphasizing the interplay between the actual (what exists) and the virtual (latent potentials or possibilities) in the continual generation of novel forms and meanings. These planes highlight how identity and thought are not isolated phenomena but ongoing negotiations within assemblies of populations, external systems, and artifacts. [[@rijos]]

> In this regard, Beer’s reference (2014) to the work of Maturana and Varela (1980) may be recalled. The latter scholars emphasised that any understanding of the cognitive capabilities of living systems is crucially dependent on a grasp of the structural genesis of their organisation. In this regard, Maturana and Varela used the concept of autopoiesis, (also picked up on by Beer 2004) – a notion which might be brought into fruitful dialogue with Deleuze’s transcendental empiricism. Importantly, the Deleuze scholar Manuel DeLanda (2011) has already done work to trace the implications of Deleuze’s thought for the study of the emergence of complexity and specifically synthetic reason, and the conceptual model of a situated, embodied, dynamic AI architecture might benefit from exploring the practical applications of this evolutionary line of thought.
