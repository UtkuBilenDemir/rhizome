# Political Phenomena

> Building on this foundation, it becomes increasingly evident that political phenomena are deeply entrenched across all realms of human and nonhuman interaction, extending far beyond the visible structures of governance or formal social organization. Even in domains frequently perceived as neutral or objective—such as computer science, artificial intelligence research, and data science—there exists a substratum of embedded assumptions about instrumentality, anthropocentrism, identity, and agency. These latent assumptions influence not only the design and implementation of these technologies but also their broader societal impacts, shaping the trajectories of knowledge production and institutional power.

> Intersectionality, when viewed through Haraway’s lens of hybridity, moves beyond human-centric categories to recognize that identities are formed in relation to broader assemblages that include ecological systems, technological networks, and cultural artifacts. For instance, a person’s experience of gender or race cannot be understood in isolation but must be analyzed in the context of intersecting influences—such as access to technology, environmental conditions, or historical legacies of colonization—that shape their lived reality.
