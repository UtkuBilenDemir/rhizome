# Subjectivity
> Michel Foucault’s critique of the essential self exemplifies this perspective. In The Order of Things, he speaks of the “death of man,” challenging the very notion of a coherent, unified human subject. Foucault asserts, “As the archaeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end” (The Order of Things, 1970). Through his genealogical method, Foucault unearthed the constructed and historically contingent nature of human subjectivity, revealing how the concept of “man” emerged as a product of specific discourses and power structures.

## Negative Augmentation [[@rijos]]
> Negative augmentation, therefore, serves as, what I call here a praxis of revealing, a deliberate process of uncovering latent (virtual) possibilities within identity and thought by not just dismantling sedimented layers of meaning but by configuring static planes as generative potentials. The praxis of revealing, then, is an active, transformative process that seeks to bring to light the hidden, overlooked, or suppressed dimensions of identity, thought, and experience. It involves systematically deconstructing entrenched frameworks and assumptions that limit human understanding, revealing the contingent and constructed nature of concepts often taken as given or universal. By peeling back these layers, the praxis of revealing does not simply negate existing formations but opens pathways for the emergence of new meanings, relationships, and possibilities. [[@rijos]]
