# Difference, Repetition, Singularity

> <mark class="hltr-grey">The role of the imagination, or the mind which contemplates in its multiple and fragmented states, is to draw something new from repetition, to draw difference from it. For that matter, repetition is itself in essence imaginary, since the imagination alone here forms the “moment” of the vis repetitiva from the point of view of constitution: it makes that which it contracts appear as elements or cases of repetition. Imaginary repetition is not a false repetition which stands in for the absent true repetition: true repetition takes place in imagination.  [@deluze1994], 76 [[@kruger2021]]

> Once manifested as thought, furthermore, the thinking that happens is divergent and ramifying rather than convergent and identifying. [[@kruger2021]], 175

> Thought emerges out of an evanescent materiality. It is exactly at this point where Deleuze parts ways with Kant. While the latter accepted the existence of a priori categories of mind that would stabilise and universalise the thought of the thinking subject, Deleuze maintains the radically empirical nature of the emergence of any transcendental structures. Thought emerges out of experience and can only ever be a response to experience. Experience, in turn, is bound up with matter, in the non-identical repetition of material intensities.
