# Serres

Accordin to Serres, there is a background noise, a parasite in the background o fcommunication and it both offers possibility, contingency, energy potential where novelty can arise [@tucker2021]

> how order emerges from chaos/disorder. In a sense,  this is Serres’ notion of mediation – life as communication and relation means that  noise is, in effect, everywhere. Mediation is then at the heart of life. Mediation becomes  the unit of analysis – and objects and subject are seen always-already in relation to  mediation. In this framing of communication, mediation becomes the primary source  of potential future knowledge and experience. 

then a different concept is needed, and for  Serres it is noise (similarities exist with Simondon’s preindividuation, Deleuze’s virtual).
