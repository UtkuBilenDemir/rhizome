One could argue that artificial intelligence is \emph{no longer an engineering discipline} \parencite[206]{dignum2023}, if it has ever truly been one.


The present thesis builds on critical perspectives from political theory and philosophy of technology to interrogate the institutional, epistemological, and political implications of contemporary generative AI systems by analysing their architectural structures and through the analysis is situated within \gls{dg}'s conceptual apparatus of control, desire, and modulation. Together, these approaches provide the foundation to conceptualize generative AI not merely as computational artefacts but as infrastructural actors in the contemporary configuration of control societies.

\section{Research Question}

\begin{center}

	\textit{RQ: How does the development of the current AI algorithms, particularly those of generative AI models (genAI), embody, extend, or contradict Gilles Deleuze’s concept of societies of control by modulating subjectivity through its probabilistic, non-linear operation structures?}

	\textit{RQ (Alternative): To what extent can the processes of meaning-production in generative AI algorithms, particularly the transformer architecture be understood through Gilles Deleuze’s concepts of control and modulation, especially in relation to subjectivity construction via their probabilistic, non-linear operational structures?}

	\textit{RQ(Alternative)}: In what ways do generative AI models instantiate the logics of control society, and how might their probabilistic architectures transform the institutional production of subjectivity and meaning?

\end{center}

\subsection{Possible lines of argument}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The distributional structure of generative AI, which produces content based on joint probability distributions, creates a dynamic of non-linear causality that reflects modulation without control, where subjectivity isiiiii formed through continuous, data-driven modulation rather than direct causative action in the absence of directional control. %\sidenote{In line with Deleuze's own argument in his other works: Capitalism decodes, but does not necessarily recode. The dividualising process also functions as a mechanism to keep movements built on these parts within specific thresholds or asymptotes; "Your ethnicity has been recognised, buy a flag".}
	\item Despite their current state, future genAI models
	      offer unique ways for individuals to create lines of
	      flight and support the becoming of nomadic subjects. %\sidenote{This aligns with the construction of schizo connections as described in \textit{Anti-Oedipus} \cite*{deleuze1983}.}
	\item Transformer-based genAI systems operate as infrastructural institutions that govern subjectivity through modulation rather than disciplinary enclosure; their architectures do not command but statistically orchestrate behavior and meaning.
	\item Rather than merely reflecting ideology, genAI systems produce truth regimes through processes of probabilistic inscription, positioning themselves as epistemic institutions within the broader infrastructure of control.
	\item Despite their instrumental role in capitalist modulation, genAI architectures retain machinic singularities that can be redirected toward critique, invention, and experimental modes of subjectivation, forming potential “lines of flight.”
\end{itemize}


\section{State of the Art}

While there are various attempts to adapt the notion of control to modern
digital developments, such as those by \cite{brusseau2020}, or partially or completely rejecting the concept of control as an inadequate explanation of current digital power structures (see, for example, \cite{hui2015}), these works either overlook the novelty and potential of genAI mechanisms or fail to explore the \textit{dividual} dimension.  Furthermore, earlier works focusing specifically on the aspect of dividualisation (see e.g. \cite{Cheney2011, Otterlo2013}) are, unfortunately, temporally limited as they were unable to analyse generative models that had not yet reached the level of advancement we see today.

Other theorists focus on various aspects of genAI models, with a common tendency to analyse ethical considerations, their application under neoliberal governmentality, and their role within surveillance capitalism (see e.g. \cite{zuboff2019, gillespie2024, Haggerty2000}). While these aspects are not outside the scope of this research, they were central to my previous bachelor's thesis.  This current study specifically focuses on the structure of probabilistic models, particularly examining their construction at present (and speculatively in the future), without delving into how their misuse (or intentional use) may play out.

Furthermore, while this study addresses the political implications of current generative AI usage, its focus is primarily on the analysis of power operations and, within this context, relevant to questions of democracy only insofa\ as they relate to the operation of power.  This study does not, however, aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of democratic risks associated with AI, as explored by others (see e.g. \cite{zarkadakes2020}; \cite{coeckelbergh2024a}).

This research, therefore, is focused on three primary areas of debate: (1) an analysis of genAI models as entities deploying power, examining their mechanisms (see e.g. \cite{amoore2024, konik2015, mackenzie2021}); (2) modern reflections on Deleuze's theory (see e.g. \cite{mischke2021, poster2010}); and (3) sources analysing algorithmic structures with technical expertise (see e.g. \cite{vaswani2017a, bender2021b}).
