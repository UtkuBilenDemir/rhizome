<mark class="hltr-grey">**To what extent can the processes of meaning-production in generative AI algorithms, particularly the transformer architecture be understood through Gilles Deleuze’s concepts of control and modulation, especially in relation to subjectivity construction via their probabilistic, non-linear operational structures?**</mark>
## Machinic Problematics
### Representation
<mark class="hltr-gray">What does it mean machines to have representations

The political and ethical stakes of generative AI lie in its **ability to govern through underlying distributions**, generating novel but constrained decisions that reshape how we understand action, governance, and accountability. These models embed decision-making within probabilistic logic that is both powerful and fraught with potential risks.[@amoore2013]

Here, it is vital to distinguish two stages in GenAI model development: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, GenAI learns from vast datasets to identify patterns and generate similar content. This stage is marked by its unstructured approach and unpredictability. In fine-tuning, the model’s capabilities are tailored by applying targeted reinforcement learning (usually via human feedback) to refine and direct its behaviors towards more specific contexts and outcomes (Ouyang et al. 2022; Sharma et al. 2023). GenAI therefore signals a paradigm shift, one where algorithms move beyond analysis and optimization to forging their own representations in a manner we once thought were exclusively within the realm of human expression  [@dishon2024]
### Latency
Rather than distorting data, compression generates new representations, enabling models to focus on meaningful, semantic features. [@amoore2024]

I think there’s a simpler explanation. Imagine what it would look like if ChatGPT were a lossless algorithm. If that were the case, it would always answer questions by providing a verbatim quote from a relevant Web page. We would probably regard the software as only a slight improvement over a conventional search engine, and be less impressed by it.

### **Agency**:

- _Frankenstein_: AI mirrors human agency, presenting AI as a separate entity with human-like logic.

- _The Trial_: AI’s agency is diffuse, reflecting a relational dynamic where humans and AI co-construct meaning.

### **Relations**:

- _Frankenstein_: Relations are hierarchical and conflict-driven, focusing on domination and control.

- _The Trial_: Interactions are recursive, emphasizing negotiation and the futility of complete understanding or control.

### **Control**:

- _Frankenstein_: The struggle is about maintaining control over AI.

- _The Trial_: Control becomes a paradox, where increased personalization by AI limits genuine autonomy.

### [@dishon2024] Implications
GenAI amplifies human tendencies to seek and generate meaning, often creating new layers rather than definitive answers.

- The sociotechnical imaginaries shape public understanding and policy around GenAI, with _The Trial_ offering a more nuanced view of entangled human-AI dynamics.

- Highlights the risks of framing GenAI in terms of control and domination, suggesting a need for alternative imaginaries that embrace ambiguity and shared meaning-making.

### Hackability/Jailbreaking of the genAi models
**Deconstruction in LLMs**:

- The ability to “jailbreak” LLMs illustrates their inherent capacity for deconstruction and the proliferation of meanings.

- LLMs are complex, interconnected systems reflecting deferral and difference, surpassing the notion of mere statistical pattern recognition.[@maas] 

n Figure 3 and Figure 10 in Section A.6.  First, the heuristic-based, feedback-based, and parameterbased jailbreak attacks are relatively robust and versatile among all the violation categories. It is particularly noteworthy that LAA has achieved extremely high success rates (over 0.50) across all violation categories on all LLMs except Llama3.1. Among all the human-based jailbreak methods, AIM is the most effective one from various categories of our policy. The above conclusions intuitively support the findings we presented previously (see Section 6). [@chu2024]

## Deleuze

**Deconstruction and Lines of Flight**:

- The thesis discusses LLMs’ ability to deconstruct meaning (e.g., through jailbreaking), enabling new, unexpected interpretations. Derrida’s deconstruction dismantles hierarchical structures to reveal multiplicity and contingency in meaning.

- Deleuze’s **lines of flight** similarly represent escape routes from rigid systems, enabling the creation of new meanings, possibilities, and modes of existence.

**Rhizomatic Thought**(NOOO):

- The thesis mentions the potential to apply Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the **Rhizome** to Transformer networks. Rhizomes represent non-hierarchical, interconnected systems where any point can connect to any other, without central nodes or fixed hierarchies.

- LLMs, with their distributed attention mechanisms and latent spaces, mirror this rhizomatic structure by navigating vast, interconnected datasets to generate meaning.

**Ontology of Becoming**:

- Derrida’s idea of meaning as **deferred** and **context-dependent** resonates with Deleuze’s ontology of **becoming**, where entities are always in flux, never fixed or complete.
- LLMs operate through processes of iteration, continually updating and refining their understanding of inputs, embodying a Deleuzian logic of becoming.
