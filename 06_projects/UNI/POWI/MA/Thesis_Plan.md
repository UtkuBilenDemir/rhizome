# Thesis_Plan

# 📄 Master's Thesis Plan – Generative AI, Deleuze, and Control Societies  
**Date:** `2025-01-04`  
**Goal:** Structure and complete the thesis by **March 2025**, with a presentation due at the end of January.  

---

## 🏁 Phase 1: Immediate Next Steps (Jan 4 - Jan 15)  
**Focus Areas:**  
- 📂 Organize notes and consolidate materials into LaTeX.  
- 🛠️ Develop a thesis outline and structure.  
- 📊 Prepare slides for the **January 30-31 presentation.**  

---

### ✅ Tasks (Jan 4 - Jan 11): Consolidation and Structuring  
- [ ] **Import handwritten notes** into Obsidian and LaTeX.  
- [ ] Transcribe key insights from:  
   - [ ] AI and control societies.  
   - [ ] Modulation, dividuation, and assemblages.  
   - [ ] Autopoiesis, Burroughs, Byung-Chul Han.  
- [ ] **Create Obsidian folders for:**  
   - `Theoretical Framework`  
   - `State of the Art`  
   - `Case Studies`  
   - `Hypotheses`  
- [ ] Draft **Introduction (2-3 pages)** in LaTeX.  
- [ ] Develop initial thesis **skeleton structure.**  
- [ ] Start **presentation draft** (key concepts, AI mechanics, philosophical lens).  

> [!tip] **Presentation Tip**  
> Structure slides around **Foucault to Deleuze transition, generative AI as modulation,** and case studies.  

---

## 📚 Phase 2: Literature Review (Jan 12 - Jan 18)  
### 🎯 Goal: Build a comprehensive **State of the Art** section.  

**Focus:**  
- **Algorithmic governance** (Amoore, Zuboff).  
- **AI dividuation and modulation** (Van Otterlo, Cheney-Lippold).  
- **Control critiques and generative AI ethics** (Rouvroy, Hui, Bender).  

### ✅ Tasks:  
- [ ] Draft **State of the Art (5-7 pages).**  
- [ ] Integrate **notes from PDFs** into literature sections.  
- [ ] Summarize insights from **handwritten notes** on dividuation, assemblages, and modulation.  
- [ ] Address gaps in existing literature on **generative AI and power.**  
- [ ] Cross-reference **Burroughs' and Han’s ideas** on deterritorialization and psychopolitics.  

> [!quote] 📖 Key Question  
> *How does AI fill the gaps in knowledge and power, and does it produce creativity or reinforce hegemonic structures?*  

---

## 🧱 Phase 3: Theoretical Framework (Jan 19 - Jan 25)  
### 🎯 Goal: Establish the core **philosophical foundation** for the thesis.  

**Key Concepts to Expand:**  
- **Foucault:** Disciplinary power, surveillance, biopolitics.  
- **Deleuze:** Control societies, modulation, dividuals.  
- **Amoore:** Algorithmic governmentality.  
- **Autopoiesis:** Self-sustaining AI (Varela, Beer).  
- **Burroughs:** Lines of flight, schizoanalysis.  

---

### ✅ Tasks:  
- [ ] Write **10-15 pages** on **Theoretical Framework.**  
- [ ] Focus on:  
   - [ ] Modulation vs. Discipline.  
   - [ ] Fluidity, feedback loops, dividuals.  
   - [ ] AI as autopoietic systems.  
- [ ] Integrate **handwritten reflections** on AI and control.  

> [!tip]  
> Use **Amoore’s distributional politics** to emphasize AI’s modulation of populations through probabilistic models.  

---

## 📈 Phase 4: Analysis – Generative AI (Jan 26 - Jan 31)  
### 🎯 Goal: Apply the theoretical framework to **case studies and AI systems.**  

---

### ✅ Tasks:  
- [ ] Start the **Analysis (15-20 pages).**  
- [ ] Focus on:  
   - [ ] Generative AI (GPT, Midjourney).  
   - [ ] Modulation of user behavior.  
   - [ ] Dividualization and personalization algorithms.  
- [ ] Explore **feedback loops, content curation, and desire production.**  
- [ ] Highlight **political implications** through case studies.  
- [ ] Develop final **presentation slides.**  

> [!example] 📊 Case Study Example  
> - **Midjourney/ChatGPT** – How generative AI alters desire and subjectivity by producing new content flows based on probabilistic modeling.  

---

## 📆 Phase 5: Full Writing Schedule (Feb - March)  

---

### 📌 February Goals:  
- **Weeks 1-3:**  
   - [ ] Write the **Analysis and Resistance** chapters.  
- **Week 4:**  
   - [ ] Draft **Conclusion** and refine the introduction.  

---

### 📌 March Goals:  
- [ ] **Editing and Revision.**  
- [ ] Conduct **peer review** (if possible).  
- [ ] Finalize **citations, formatting,** and LaTeX.  
- [ ] Prepare **submission by mid-March.**  

---

> [!important] **Final Deliverables:**  
> - 📄 80-100 page thesis.  
> - 🎓 Presentation slides.  
> - 📚 Comprehensive literature review.  

---
