## Current direction 20250105

In th primitive phase of ai humans were anchored dto their past and associated social groups, it created echo-chambers, but right now there is a content tailoring process for human use, we are deeper in a debate about agency right now. [@dishon2024]

> The Trial is not about humans losing control over their creations, if they ever had control in the first place. Instead, it foreshadows GenAI’s capacity to generate content that is personalized to every actor (and thus shaped by humans) yet is not amenable to control through explicit choices. This model of meaningmaking undermines the dichotomy between choice and coercion, no longer positioning the two as mutually exclusive.

This is a study about Power & AI
## Algorithmic Governmentality in Post-Disciplinary Societies

There is a **Algorithmic Governmentality in the Post-Disciplinary Societies**, and we are analysing it

- How does the new institutional formations function [@mackenzie2021: 2]
	- Mackenzie also mentions if the articulation of the critique in control societies really says anything about possible new forms of **resistance**. This is a particularly important point, namely if you are going to analyse the resistance. Think about Deleuze's schizoanalysis and nomadic subject, aren't the llms deploying new forms of "swaying away" as much as they offer modulation?

## Random Quotes and Ideas

"Political is a form of digital technology, political is defined through some form of discretisation" [[Digital Philosophy]]

Political is our digitalisation of the world, we are digitalising machines

### An idea regarding the analysis of Deleuze's postscript
> Deleuze’s essay is split into three sections: ‘History’, ‘Logic’, and ‘Program’, with  the middle section afforded the most space.
[[@mackenzie2021]]

### An idea to include Galloway
- [ ] Explore the following
Galloway provides a striking case in point: ‘the society  of control is characterized not by the power of the institutions of modernity, or  pre-modernity, the army, the prison, the university, the church, but instead by  what he [Deleuze] called the ultra-rapid forms of free-floating control that are  inherent in distributed networks’ (Galloway, 2006, pp. 318-9). [[@mackenzie2021]]

**Furthermore**: 
we suggest  that it remains crucial to understand the transition from discipline to control as a  process in which the institutions are transformed, rather than treating it as the  emergence of a de-institutionalized social formation. The aim is not to criticize  technological accounts of control – in fact, they are becoming especially pertinent  as the everyday lifeworld we inhabit is increasingly governed by computational or  algorithmic logics – but to complement those analyses with an awareness of the  how institutions function in control societies.

## Section Candidates
- [[Dividualisation]] : From the regimes of individualisation to the regimes of dividualisation.
- **AI**
	- [[Non-Labeling]]: Labeling has direction and transparency, unsupervised learning do not [[@amoore2024]].
	- [[Attention]]: We need schizo-machines to get out of the context of attention
	- [[Convergence]]: The weights are converging, and AI is currently incapable of generation of truly creative data

## Nifty ideas
- [[Banality of Singularity]]
- Assessing an underlying distribution reveals that there are other distributions very likely to exist.

## Current line of argumentation
[[(inc)Desire]] is revolutionary, and the power is the regulation of the desire. De- and reterritorialisation of desire is the discipline, it is control, it is the government. AI is regulation, tjhe regulation of power by the production of truth. Our own truth in the end, but in its most generalistic and status-quo sensitive form.
