## Questions

> [!question] 
> **A.**  Describe the philosophical shift Karl Marx makes between his 1844 text _“Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts”_ and _“Capital, Volume I”_ (1867). Identify and explain one main theoretical innovation from each text. Then evaluate whether key elements of "Marxist humanism" remain present in _“Capital, Volume I”_. Provide evidence to support your argument.

Between his **Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts (1844)** and **Capital, Volume I (1867)**, Marx shifts from a **philosophical, humanist critique of alienation** which is construced form a universalist and metaphysical perspective toward a more **scientific, structural analysis of capitalism** under the context of political economy.

In **1844**, Marx focuses on **alienation**—the estrangement of workers from labor, their own essence (_species-being_), and each other.
1. From the product of their own labor: Worker put their work into the commodity, but now the commodity separated form them. By producing, the worker obtains less wealth. World of commodity and the owners of the labour became more wealthy, worker of the world less.
2. From their activity of labour: The work, an inherent activity to the worker is now not something they themselves own. The work is for someone else, and not under the freedom of the worker. In what partition of the life is the worker free? In animalistic activities, eating, drinking etc. 
3. From their species being: The human is the one engendering the world, turning the the earth as a body without organs into a specific organisation, the human is digitalising one to an analog universe. Taking away the product of its labour is also taking the inherent quality of their species away from them.
4. Form each other: The life activity of the man is taken away form themselves, therefore its relation to other men is also taken away. Moreover, the labor now belongs someone else who doesn't have a connection to labour, owning the product of labor without having any connection to the labour. 

In his structural analysis in the Capital, Marx leans more towards a theory of political economy. The analysis starts with the most characteristic and atomic element of the capitalist mode of production, the commodity. While the value of the commodities defined between the relation between commodities, the labour behind the production gets concealed. Commodities become a supernatural spirit as if nothing about them has any connection to their production process and as if they inherited their value from some mystical "essence" leading to a fetish character. 

Marx' humanism doesn't go anywhere, it just shifts into being a more structural analysis focusing on the nature of the capitalist mode of production itself. Moreover, Marxist project has in its core enlightenment, so, while EPM focuses on its social aspects, in the first part of Capital, Marx tries to demistify capitalist mechanism of production and reproduction of production. Demistification of the social relations under this production mechanism is also purused in different way in other parts of the Capital.

> [!question] 
> **B.**  Judith Butler and Pierre Bourdieu both explore how social categories shape our bodies, bodily expressions, and behaviors. Identify and explain the primary concept of each theorist that relates to this theme as discussed in class. Highlight how their respective frameworks differ, or align with each other, in understanding the relationship between social structures and the body.

**Judith Butler: Gender as Performance**

- **Primary Concept:** _Performativity_ (from _Gender Trouble_, 1990).
- **Core Idea:** Gender is not a fixed identity but a **repeated performance** of socially constructed norms.
- **How it relates to the body:** The body is not naturally gendered but is **given meaning** through repeated, socially sanctioned acts.
Performativity is a central concept to Butler's theory. Gender is not a fixed identity but a repeated performance of socially constructed forms. As much as how Foucault's institutions produce docile bodies, heteronormativity produces the genders through the social modes established by the history of the operation of a specicif power structure. The body or subjectivity in general for that matter is getting shaped by a repetititve social framework of relations and actions.

**Pierre Bourdieu: Habitus and Bodily Practice**

- **Primary Concept:** _Habitus_ (from _Distinction_, 1979).

- **Core Idea:** Social structures shape **our bodily dispositions, movements, and practices** in a way that feels “natural” but is actually learned through socialization.

- **How it relates to the body:** The body **embodies** social hierarchy; for example, class distinctions are expressed through posture, language, and everyday behavior.

Similarly, Bourdieu notes that th social structures shape our bodily disposition, movements, and practices in a way that feels natural but actually establised through social repettions. The body embodies the social hierarchy in this way, class distinctions and the acceptance for it is expressed through posture, language, everytday behaviour.Butler’s framework allows for resistance; Bourdieu’s habitus implies constrained agency, as structures prefigure bodily “sense” of place.:w

**Alignment & Difference**

- **Alignment:** Both theorists show how **social structures inscribe themselves onto bodies**, shaping our actions unconsciously.

- **Difference:**

- Butler focuses on **gender and performativity**, emphasizing how **acts reproduce norms** (e.g., femininity through dress, voice).

- Bourdieu focuses on **class and embodied habitus**, showing how **social origins shape bodily practice** (e.g., upper-class individuals move and speak differently from working-class individuals).

There are differences in terms of how social structures inscribed into us. difference is gender and class topics. Both reject biological determinism, seeing the body as a site of social inscription.

> [!question]
> **C.**  Explain Aníbal Quijano’s concept of "epistemicide" and its significance. Then, analyze how his theory of the "coloniality of power" provides a foundation for María Lugones' feminist critique. In your response, include specific ways Lugones builds on or diverges from Quijano’s work to address the intersection of coloniality and gender.

**Quijano’s “Epistemicide”**:  
The destruction of Indigenous/colonized knowledge systems by European colonialism, which imposed a Eurocentric “coloniality of knowledge” to legitimize racial hierarchies.

**Coloniality of Power**:  
Quijano argues colonialism established a global racial/class hierarchy that persists post-independence, with race as a tool of capitalist exploitation.

**Lugones’ Feminist Foundation**:  
Lugones builds on Quijano by introducing **gender coloniality**:

- **Divergence**: Quijano centers race/class; Lugones shows how colonialism _invented_ gender binaries to subjugate non-European women (e.g., framing Indigenous women as “bestial” to justify rape/forced labor).
    
- **Intersection**: Coloniality’s “modern gender system” intersects with race to create the “coloniality of gender”—a system where white bourgeois women are “human,” while women of color remain dehumanized.

**Significance**: Lugones reveals how decolonization requires dismantling _both_ racial and gender hierarchies.

Quijano focuses on **race as the key axis of coloniality**.

Lugones argues that **race and gender are co-constituted** under colonialism.

> [!question]
> **D.**  In _Discipline and Punish_, Michel Foucault describes the transition from sovereign power, characterized by public punishment of the body, to disciplinary power, focused on the soul and creating docile bodies.
> 
> 
> 1. Explain Foucault’s concept of the "micro-physics of power" and how it operates in modern institutions like schools, prisons, or factories.
> 2. Using the concept of "panopticism," analyze how disciplinary power shapes individual behavior and self-regulation in contemporary society.
> 3. Finally, critically evaluate one limitation or critique of Foucault’s theory of power, such as its treatment of agency or structural inequalities like gender or race.

**Micro-Physics of Power**

Micro-Physics of power is a consept focusing on the specifics of the operation of the power. Which regulates and reproduces the modern subjectivity. Foucault especially focuses on how the operations of the microphysics of power is articulated into its structure in the disciplinary societies, how schools, prisons, hospitals practiced it. Instead of a **sovereign punishing the body**, **modern power disciplines the soul**, training people to **self-regulate**.

**Panopticism & Self-Regulation**
 Inspired by **Bentham’s Panopticon** (a prison where inmates can be watched at any time, but don’t know when). In modern society, we **internalize** surveillance—acting as if we are always being watched, thus **self-disciplining** our behavior. The power becomes an internal force with an efficient use of surveillance and correction techniques through but not limited to the institutions.

**Limitation of Foucault’s Theory**

- **Lack of focus on structural inequalities**:

- Critics (e.g., **Feminist & Critical Race theorists**) argue he ignores how **race, gender, and class shape power**.

- Example: Black feminist scholar **Patricia Hill Collins** critiques him for not addressing **racialized surveillance**.

> [!question]
> **E.**  The quote which is most often evoked from Simone de Beauvoir’s _The Second Sex_ is, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman."
>1. Explain what Beauvoir means by this statement in the context of her existentialist framework.
> 2. Does this quote encapsulate the central arguments of the book? If yes, how so? If not, how so?

**Meaning in Existentialist Context**

**Gender is not innate** but socially constructed. Women are conditioned into passivity, immanence and "Otherness" throughout the social history of mankind. Beyond this functional categorisation, women are defined through the male terms and only in relation to the men taking away the existentalist exploration of women themselves.
Yes and No;
**Yes** but with nuance: It summarizes her core argument—women are not naturally inferior but are **made subordinate by social structures**. However, Beauvoir's analysis expands far beyond that by analyzing biology, history, psychoanalysis**, and critiques how myths about femininity perpetuate oppression.

> 
> Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, and Patricia Hill Collins each address universal themes in their theories of oppression and liberation. However, their ideas also reflect tensions between claims of universality and the specificities of social categories such as class, race, and gender.
> 
> Write an essay critically analyzing how each thinker grapples with universalism in their theories:
> 
> In your essay:
> 
> - Discuss the strengths and limitations of each thinker’s approach to universalism.
> - Consider why they embrace, or reject, universalism. What work does it do in their respective theories and social critique?
> - Conclude by evaluating whether social theory has changed over time from universalist claims, to the rejection of universalism.

Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, and Patricia Hill Collins each theorize oppression and liberation through distinct lenses of class, race, and gender. Their approaches reveal tensions between universalist frameworks—which seek overarching explanations of human struggle—and attention to the specificities of social categories. This essay critically analyzes how each thinker navigates this tension, evaluating the strengths and limitations of their approaches.

### Karl Marx: Universal Class Struggle

Marx’s theory of historical materialism posits class conflict as the universal engine of history. In _The Communist Manifesto_, he frames proletarian revolution as a global necessity, arguing that capitalism’s exploitation transcends national and cultural boundaries. For Marx, the proletariat’s emancipation would liberate all humanity, as class is the primary axis of oppression.

**Strengths and Limitations**:  
Marx’s universalism provides a unifying framework for solidarity, emphasizing systemic economic structures. However, his focus on class obscures race and gender as co-constitutive forms of oppression. For instance, his analysis of primitive accumulation in _Capital_ neglects colonialism’s racialized violence, a gap later addressed by Fanon.

**Why Embrace Universalism?**  
Marx views capitalism as a global system; thus, universal class struggle is both analytical and strategic. Universalism legitimizes revolution as a collective project, uniting workers beyond parochial divisions.

### Frantz Fanon: Universal Humanism Through Anti-Colonialism

In _The Wretched of the Earth_, Fanon centers race and colonialism, arguing that liberation requires dismantling the dehumanizing logic of colonial rule. While he critiques Eurocentric universalism, he envisions a _new humanism_ emerging from the struggles of the colonized.

**Strengths and Limitations**:  
Fanon’s universalism is rooted in the particular experience of colonized subjects, rejecting abstract Eurocentric ideals. However, his focus on race and nationalism risks marginalizing gender, as seen in his limited engagement with women’s roles in liberation movements.

**Why Embrace Universalism?**  
Fanon sees anti-colonial struggle as a path to redefine humanity itself, transcending racial hierarchies. His universalism is aspirational, aiming to reconstruct human dignity after colonialism’s fragmentation.

### Patricia Hill Collins: Rejecting Universalism via Intersectionality

Collins’ _Black Feminist Thought_ rejects universalism, advocating for intersectionality—the idea that race, gender, class, and sexuality interlock to produce unique systems of oppression. She critiques Marxist and white feminist theories for universalizing the experiences of dominant groups (e.g., white workers or middle-class women).

**Strengths and Limitations**:  
Intersectionality captures the complexity of lived experience, challenging monolithic theories. However, critics argue that rejecting universalism risks political fragmentation, as solidarity becomes harder to forge across differences.

**Why Reject Universalism?**  
Collins argues that universalist claims often reflect the standpoint of privileged groups. By centering Black women’s experiences, she exposes how power operates through overlapping systems (the "matrix of domination").

### Conclusion: From Universalism to Rejection?

Social theory has shifted markedly from Marx’s class universalism to Collins’ intersectional particularism, reflecting postmodern critiques of grand narratives. Fanon occupies a middle ground, blending anti-colonial particularism with a reconstructed universal humanism. Yet this shift is not absolute: contemporary movements like climate justice or global feminism show renewed appeals to universal solidarity, albeit tempered by intersectional critiques. Ultimately, the tension between universalism and specificity remains productive, forcing theorists to balance inclusive solidarity with respect for difference.
