==This is what Marx refers to as the "fantastic form of a relation between things"â€”commodities seem to have a life of their own, determining their interactions with each other, while the human labor that created them is hidden.==

==Analogy to gods: Marx draws a parallel with the religious world, where the creations of human minds (gods, spirits) are treated as independent beings with their own power. Similarly, commodities, which are products of human labor, seem to take on a mystical quality, as if they have their own value and exist independently of the labour that created them.==

### Fetishism
