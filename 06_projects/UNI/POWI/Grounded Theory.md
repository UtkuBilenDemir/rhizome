# Grounded Theory

- <mark class="hltr-orange">"‘grounded theory’, it may be built up in the course of the research, but then be available for further research and the study of other cases. Cases are not broken down into variables but considered as interdependent wholes; generalization is achieved by assigning cases to classes and approximating them to ideal types.”</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WCKILV8Z?page=9&annotation=2GVUB9YT) [[@dellaporta2008|dellaporta2008]]
