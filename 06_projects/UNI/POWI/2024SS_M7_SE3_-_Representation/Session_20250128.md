**"Citizens' Perceptions on Party Representation"**  

### Summary
This proposal investigates how **socioeconomic factors** (e.g., income, education) shape Austrian citizens’ perceptions of which political parties best represent different social groups, against the backdrop of declining traditional "people’s parties" (SPÖ/ÖVP). Leveraging **descriptive representation** as well as **group identification** and data from the Austrian National Election Survey, it adapts a **Dissimilarity Index** to analyze gaps between perceived party-group linkages and respondents’ socioeconomic profiles, offering novel insights into democratic representation in fragmented party systems.

### **Strengths**  
-  **Timely & Relevant Topic**: Focus on declining Austrian "people’s parties" (SPÖ/ÖVP) and shifting voter perceptions aligns with current political trends.  
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Clear use of ~~**descriptive representation** (Pitkin) and~~ **group identification** (Sanchez/Vargas) to frame socioeconomics as proxies for representation.  
**Methodological Rigor**: 
- Very well defined methodological approach
   - Adapts Zelinska & Dubrow’s [[**Dissimilarity Index**]] to measure gaps between perceived party representation and respondents’ socioeconomic profiles.  
   - A good analysis of **Austrian National Election Survey (2017–2024)** data with 11,184 respondents.  
**Literature Gap**: Comprehensive, identifies underexplored area—citizens’ *perceptions* of party-group linkages (vs. candidate traits or parliamentary representation).

## **Areas for Improvement**  
- I would expect descriptive representation to be associated with some kind of demographical/identity related aspects of the representatives. These people are not necessarily from that said groups -> I do not know if descriptive representation is the right conception.
- This particular sentence could be criticised: 
>While party membership as group identification has been high in twentieth century Austria, in  recent decades it has decreased a lot. Thus, referring to a person’s choice for party  representation must be drawn from socioeconomic factors.

Is it really a justification for that? People can keep their political alignment and still stay out of parties.

- Seeing a couple of **Hypotheses** would have been of help

### Challenges
- **Operationalization Clarity**:  How exactly are variables like education (Austrian tiers) and income categorized?  
- **Single-Wave Limitation**: Independent variable (party-group perceptions) only measured in **Wave 14 (June 2022)**.  
- **Theoretical Nuance**:  
   - Contrast descriptive representation with **substantive** (policy-based) or **symbolic** (cultural) representation.  
   - Address why socioeconomics matter more than other factors (e.g., ideology).  

---
### **Recommendations**  
- **Refine Variable Definitions**:  
   - Example: Map Austrian education levels (e.g., *Pflichtschule* = "base level").  
   - Clarify how residency/age/gender intersect with socioeconomics.  
- **Contextualize Findings**:  
   - Discuss Austria’s **GAL/TAN divide** (Hooghe & Marks 2009) and fragmentation of party system.  
-  **Method Transparency**:  
   - Detail how the **Dissimilarity Index** is calculated for survey data (vs. parliamentary seats).
