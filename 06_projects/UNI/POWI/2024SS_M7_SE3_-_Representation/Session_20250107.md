# [@canes-wrone2004] 🏛️ The Conditional Nature of Presidential Responsiveness to Public Opinion  
**Authors**: Brandice Canes-Wrone & Kenneth W. Shotts  
**Published in**: *American Journal of Political Science (2004)*  

## 📚 Summary  
This study investigates how public opinion shapes presidential policymaking, focusing on the conditions under which presidents align their policies with mass preferences. The authors test various hypotheses regarding responsiveness using data on presidential budgetary proposals and public opinion surveys across major policy issues.  

- [u] ==In terms of the first factor, most research indicates that responsiveness is more likely the sooner the president is running for reelection. For instance, Canes-Wrone, Herron, and Shotts (2001) and Zaller (2003) reach this conclusion via the argument that voters care more about policy outcomes than initial policy choices once the outcomes become known.==
- [u] ==Policy congruence between presidential positions and public opinion is more likely the sooner is the next election.  The basic patterns in the data are quite consistent with this hypothesis. In the initial two years of a president’s term, the rate of policy congruence is 45%, whereas in the last half of a term the rate of congruence is 57%. In fact, the rate of congruence is even higher, 66%, in the final year of the term. However, it remains possible that the Electoral Proximity Hypothesis will not hold when controlling for other factors that may affect responsiveness.==

## 🔑 Key Findings  

> [!summary] **Summary of Main Findings**  
> Presidents are more likely to respond to public opinion when:  
> - The policy issue is familiar and directly relevant to citizens’ daily lives.  
> - Reelection is imminent.  
> - Their approval ratings are moderate (not too high or too low).  

### 🗳️ Political Factors Affecting Responsiveness:  
1. **Electoral Proximity**:  
   Presidents become more responsive as elections approach, maximizing alignment with public preferences to secure reelection.   
2. **Approval Ratings (Nonmonotonic Effect)**:  
   - **Moderate approval ratings** → Higher responsiveness.  
   - **Very high or low ratings** → Lower responsiveness. Presidents feel less pressure to follow public opinion.  
3. **Policy Domain**:  
   Higher responsiveness is observed for *domestic issues* (e.g., education, health) compared to *foreign policy or defense*, where presidents have greater autonomy.

## 📊 Methodology  

> [!info] **Data Sources**  
> - **Presidential budgetary proposals (1972–1999)** across 11 policy domains.  
> - **Public opinion surveys** (NORC, Roper) measuring preferences on government spending.  

### **Measurement of Policy Congruence**  
- **Dichotomous Variable**:  
  - 1 if the president's proposal aligns with majority public opinion.  
  - 0 if it does not.  
- Congruence calculated annually by policy area.  

---

## 📈 Results Overview  

> [!note] **Policy Congruence by Issue**  
> - **High Congruence**: Crime (92%), Health (92%), Social Security (100%).  
> - **Low Congruence**: Space (9%), Parks (15%), Foreign Aid (32%).  
> - **Overall**: Presidents align with public opinion in **51%** of cases.  
> 
> *Interpretation*: Presidents are more likely to align with public preferences on *high-salience domestic issues* but often diverge on *foreign policy and defense*.

## 🔍 Hypotheses Tested  

### 1. **Electoral Proximity Hypothesis**  
- **Prediction**: Policy congruence increases closer to elections.  
- **Supported**: Congruence rises from 45% early in the term to 57% in the latter half, peaking at **66% in the final year**.  

### 2. **Monotonic Popularity Hypothesis**  
- **Prediction**: Responsiveness decreases as approval increases.  
- **Not Supported**: Popularity alone does not show a linear relationship with responsiveness.  

### 3. **CHS (Canes-Wrone, Herron, Shotts) Popularity Hypothesis**  
- **Prediction**: Responsiveness peaks at **moderate** approval levels.  
- **Supported**: Presidents with **50-60%** approval are most likely to align with public opinion.

## 🛠️ Methodology Details  

> [!tip] **Statistical Model**  
> - **Logit models** with policy congruence as the dependent variable.  
> - **Control variables**:  
>   - Presidential ideological alignment.  
>   - Congressional ideological alignment.  
>   - Public concern over issues (*Gallup Most Important Problem* surveys).  

---

## ✍️ Normative Implications  

- **Positive**: Responsiveness reflects **democratic accountability** when presidents align with public opinion, enhancing representation.  
- **Negative**: Presidents may **pander** to public opinion, leading to **short-term, politically expedient decisions** even when long-term public interest may differ.  

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts  

- **Policy Congruence**: Alignment between presidential proposals and mass public opinion.  
- **Electoral Proximity**: Responsiveness increases as elections near.  
- **Nonmonotonic Responsiveness**: Highest responsiveness at **moderate approval levels** (50-60%).

# 📄 Healy and Lenz (2014) - Substituting the End for the Whole

## 📌 Overview
**Title**: Substituting the End for the Whole: Why Voters Respond Primarily to the Election-Year Economy  
**Authors**: Andrew Healy & Gabriel S. Lenz  
**Journal**: American Journal of Political Science (2014)  

### 🎯 Main Argument
Voters disproportionately weigh the election-year economy over cumulative economic performance throughout a president’s term. This is driven by an *end-heuristic*—where voters simplify their evaluations by focusing on the most recent economic conditions.

### 🧪 Methodology
- **Surveys & Experiments**:  
  Conducted across a variety of samples, including national surveys and Amazon Mechanical Turk participants.  
- **Experimental Design**:  
  Showed participants plots of economic growth during presidential terms, then measured how they evaluated the overall term.  
- **Comparison**:  
  Historical data (e.g., Clinton’s vs. Carter’s economic growth) was presented to participants to test if recency bias influenced their assessments.

### 🔑 Key Findings
1. **Election-Year Emphasis**:  
   - Voters reward incumbents primarily for election-year growth rather than term-long performance.  
   - 75% of weight is placed on the final year, while earlier years receive minimal attention.  

2. **Intentions vs. Behavior**:  
   - Voters *intend* to weigh all years equally but fail to do so in practice.  

3. **Memory Hypothesis Rejected**:  
   - Even when all economic data is presented, participants overweigh the final year, suggesting the issue isn’t about forgetting past performance.  

4. **Psychological Mechanism**:  
   - The "end-heuristic" stems from cognitive shortcuts, aligning with research in psychology (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002).

### 🛠️ Implications
- **Democratic Accountability**:  
   Politicians are incentivized to prioritize short-term growth before elections rather than long-term economic policies.  
- **Policy**:  
   Candidates could counteract this bias by explicitly presenting cumulative performance throughout the term.

# 📄 Elling (1982) - Ideological Change in the U.S. Senate: Time and Electoral Responsiveness  

## 📌 Overview
**Title**: Ideological Change in the U.S. Senate: Time and Electoral Responsiveness  
**Author**: Richard C. Elling  
**Journal**: Legislative Studies Quarterly (1982)  

### 🎯 Main Argument
Senators shift their ideological positions toward moderation as they approach reelection. This *patterned instability* indicates that electoral vulnerability influences voting behavior, encouraging senators to appeal more to their constituents over time.

### 🧪 Methodology
- **Data**:  
  Voting records from 1959-1978 (86th to 95th Congresses).  
- **Measure**:  
  ADA (Americans for Democratic Action) scores were used to assess ideological shifts.  
- **Scope**:  
  245 senators across eight electoral classes.

### 🔑 Key Findings
1. **Temporal Shifts**:  
   - Senators shift toward *ideological moderation* closer to elections.  
   - 75% of the shifts occur in a conservative direction.  

2. **Competitiveness and Vulnerability**:  
   - Senators facing narrow election margins show greater ideological shifts.  

3. **Seniority**:  
   - Less senior senators show larger shifts, possibly due to greater electoral vulnerability.  

4. **Party Differences**:  
   - Northern Democrats moderate more than Southern Democrats or Republicans.  
   - Republicans show slight shifts toward liberalism by election time.  

### 🛠️ Implications
- **Responsive Representation**:  
   Legislators adjust their positions to align with constituency preferences as elections approach, reinforcing democratic accountability.  
- **Strategic Voting**:  
   Senators may vote more ideologically early in their terms but prioritize appealing to the median voter closer to elections.

---

## 🧩 Cross-Paper Insights
- **Healy & Lenz**: Focus on voter behavior and heuristics influencing election outcomes.  
- **Elling**: Focus on how legislators adjust ideologies based on electoral cycles.  
- **Intersection**: Both papers highlight **time-based influences**—voters reward recent performance (Healy & Lenz), while legislators shift ideologies near elections (Elling).

---

## 🗂️ Key Concepts
- **End-Heuristic (Healy & Lenz)**:  
   Voters substitute the final year’s economic conditions for the whole term.  
- **Temporal Moderation (Elling)**:  
   Senators moderate ideological positions as they near reelection.  

> 	🧠 *Takeaway*: Time dynamics play a crucial role in shaping both voter behavior and legislative decision-making, reinforcing the short-term focus in electoral politics.
