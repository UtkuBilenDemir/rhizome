# Territorial Representation and the Opinion–Policy Linkage (Wratil, 2019)
- **Core Argument**: Territorial representation skews policymaking toward opinions in states where citizens care most about issues and hold unified views. 
- **Methodology**: 
	- **DATA**: inion is.  I test these claims with a novel data set from European Union (EU) politics containing information on cross-national public support for policy change as well as the EU’s adoption record for 211 policy issues on the EU’s agenda between 2004 and 2011. Methodologically, the data set builds upon “best practices” from studies of policy representation in the United States (e.g., Gilens 2012; Lax and Phillips 2012). The EU case is a suitable case to test whether territorial representation matters for the opinion–policy linkage, as opinion and salience vary across member states, interregional logrolls are standard practice, and territorial dynamics are facilitated by a weakly integrated party system (Hix 2002; Hix and Lord 1997; Hix, Noury, and Roland 2007).
  - Data from 211 EU policy issues (2004–2011).
  - Salience-weighted opinions were better predictors of policy changes than mean EU-wide opinion.
- **Findings**:
  - Salient and unified state-level opinions lead to greater policy congruence.
  - Territorial representation gives disproportionate influence to certain state opinions, challenging assumptions of EU's democratic deficit.
- **Theoretical Implications**:
  - Federal systems and logrolling practices amplify localized interests over mean preferences.
  - Raises questions about fairness and the focus of representation in federal systems.

# Political Institutions and the Opinion–Policy Link (Wlezien & Soroka, 2012)
- **Core Argument**: The responsiveness of public policy to opinion is moderated by political institutions like federalism, executive-legislative balance, and electoral systems.
- **DAta**:
	- Here we test our three conjectures relating to political institutions. The measure of relative public preferences – the variable R in the equations above – is critical. For this, we rely on the International Social Survey Program ‘Role of Government I–IV cumulative file’, combining results from the four years in which the survey has included a battery of questions on government policies, namely, 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2006.14
- **Thermostatic Model**:
  - Citizens adjust policy preferences in response to policy changes.
  - Policymakers respond dynamically to public opinion across the electoral cycle.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Policy responsiveness is higher in salient domains.
  - Vertical decentralization (federalism) blurs clarity of responsibility, weakening opinion-policy linkage.
  - Horizontal separation of powers (e.g., presidential systems) enhances responsiveness by enabling error correction.
  - Proportional electoral systems affect the link variably, often mitigating responsiveness due to coalition complexities.

# The Opinion–Policy Nexus in Europe (Rasmussen et al., 2019)
- **Core Argument**: Public policies align with majority preferences in Europe, with limited influence from political institutions on this linkage.
- **Methodology**:
	- **Data**: screened a set of cross-national public opinion surveys conducted among representative samples in at least 15 European countries, such as the Eurobarometer, European Social Survey and European Election Study, to single out questions about respondents’ preferences concerning specific policy issues.
  - Cross-sectional analysis of 20 policy issues across 31 European democracies.
  - Measured congruence and responsiveness of public policy to majority opinions.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Strong positive correlation between public opinion and policy; two-thirds of policies matched majority preferences.
  - Institutions like electoral systems, horizontal, and vertical power divisions do not consistently affect congruence or responsiveness.
  - Multilevel governance in federalist systems may dilute opinion-policy linkage.
- **Implications**:
  - Contrasts with American studies emphasizing institutional effects.
  - Suggests institutional mechanisms can have counterbalancing effects.

## Session
- Legislative - Executive power balance seems to be a little controversial among people, it could be a good idea to analyse this from a neomarxist perspective but research quantitatively?
