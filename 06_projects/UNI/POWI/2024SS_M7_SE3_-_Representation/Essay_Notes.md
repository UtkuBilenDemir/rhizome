The painter Paul Klee took the view that painting did not mimic or copy, or
even in the first instance interpret, its referent. What it did, first and
foremost, was "make visible" the referent. \parencite[51]{saward2010} .

The audience for a given representative claim might, in principle, be
coterminous with, overlap with, or even be wholly different from (including
larger or smaller than) the would-be constituency. In other words, objects are
offered, as interpretations of would-be constituencies (referents), to
audiences whose members may or may not be part of the referent. \parencite[3]{saward2009}

However, as the two authors emphasize, this construction is more than simply discursive and its “performative power assumes at a minimum that it is connected to the ‘reality’ it states: actually mobilizing the unemployed”.3 In the same way, Julien Talpin emphasizes in this issue that community organizing can only be called representative of the “community” if it actually succeeds in assembling this community through mass events which affirm its unity. \parencite[14]{dutoya2016}

Political representation takes place everywhere in civil society and it does not stop at the borders of the nation-state (Saward 2006a: 299) \parencite[1]{decreus2013}

It is because the representative exists, because he represents (symbolic action), that the group that is represented and symbolised exists and that in return it gives existence to its representative as the representative of a group" (Bourdieu 1991, 204). Likewise, Fenno (2003, 1) emphasized how "there can be no 52 Mapping the representative claim  one 'correct' way of slicing up and classifying member perceptions [of constituency] — only 'helpful' ways."

%WARNING: Outsource
Emerging as a leader of the left-leaning coalition Apruebo Dignidad, Boric positioned himself as the representative of a “new Chile,” addressing the profound social, economic, and political grievances that had erupted during the 2019 protests. His campaign framed itself as a response to the inequities of Chile’s neoliberal past and a vehicle for systemic reform through constitutional change. Boric’s campaign emphasized solidarity with marginalized communities, the youth, and progressive movements, positioning him as a representative of the “new Chile” striving for systemic reform. From the very

By constructing referents such as “the people” and “the oppressed,” Boric proposed a vision that resonated with diverse constituencies while navigating contestation from conservative forces.

This paper investigates how far Gabriel Boric’s campaign aligns with Michael Saward’s concept of representative claims, which emphasizes representation as a performative and constructive process.

By analyzing the propositional nature of Boric’s claims, including his reframing of “the people” and marginalized groups as , this study explores how his campaign articulated a vision of unity in a divided society. It argues that Boric’s success hinged on his ability to integrate diverse constituencies under a shared narrative of transformation, leveraging cultural and symbolic frameworks to validate his claims amidst contestation.
