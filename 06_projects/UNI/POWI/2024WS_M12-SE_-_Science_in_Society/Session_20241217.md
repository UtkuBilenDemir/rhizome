# Session_20241217
> [!NOTE]- Company Spokesperson: Chase Fizzington (Utku)
> 
> As one of the world’s largest beverage companies and a key user of aspartame in its product lineup, Coca-Cola holds a strong stake in the ongoing debate. The company spokesperson will present Coca-Cola’s position, emphasizing the safety of aspartame as backed by global regulatory bodies, and its role in offering consumers healthier alternatives.
> 
>   
> 
> Key talking points include:
> 
> - Aspartame’s extensive research history, making it one of the most studied artificial sweeteners globally. The spokesperson will highlight Coca-Cola’s reliance on the consensus of respected regulatory bodies like WHO, EFSA, and FDA, all of which have consistently deemed aspartame safe for consumption within recommended limits. Critics often accuse Coca-Cola and similar corporations of funding studies that favor their products. The spokesperson may counter by asserting that independent studies also support aspartame’s safety.
>     
> - The significant investments made by the industry to ensure product safety and compliance with global standards. 
>     
> - The practical benefits of aspartame as a low-calorie alternative to sugar, contributing to reduced caloric intake and addressing public health challenges such as obesity and diabetes. Coca-Cola positions itself as a socially responsible corporation offering low-calorie products to combat rising obesity rates and diabetes. The spokesperson will argue that removing aspartame would limit their ability to provide such options to consumers.
>     
> - While defending aspartame’s safety, the spokesperson will acknowledge consumer fears, blaming misinformation and sensationalized media coverage for creating unwarranted alarm.
>     
> 
>   
> 
> The spokesperson will also address concerns about substitutes, noting that while alternatives like stevia, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium exist, aspartame remains a preferred choice due to its long-standing safety record and functionality in products. The panel will explore (potential) questions such as:
> 
>   
> 
> - Why does the industry continue to use aspartame despite public concerns? Panelists may also question why Coca-Cola continues to use aspartame instead of natural alternatives like stevia, which have less controversial public perceptions. Company spokesperson will rely on the information that aspartame has been researched for much longer than the alternatives.
>     
> - How does the industry respond to claims of lobbying influence on regulatory bodies? Misinformation on the social media misrepresents Coca Cola’s funding for legitimate research as lobbying efforts. At the end, it is to our advantage for our consumers to be healthy. 
>     
> - What role should companies play in addressing consumer skepticism and fostering trust? Companies, like Coca Cola does, should support objective journalism and also invest in less privileged areas (like Coca Cola).
>     
> 
> These points will allow the company spokesperson to articulate the industry’s position while engaging with criticisms raised by other panelists.

> [!Instruction] Intoduction & Attitude
> Good afternoon, everyone. My name is **Chase Fizzington**, and I’m here representing **The Coca-Cola Company**, one of the largest beverage producers in the world and a long-standing user of aspartame. As a company committed to offering safe and enjoyable products, we value opportunities like this to engage in open, evidence-based discussions with the scientific community, media, and the public.

> _“Aspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched food additives in history. For over 40 years, global regulatory bodies like the_ **_WHO_**_,_ **_EFSA_**_, and the_ **_FDA_** _have consistently confirmed its safety when consumed within established limits.”_
> 
> _“While some studies raise questions, it’s important to look at the_ **_total body of evidence_**_. Respected regulators, informed by both industry and independent studies, have repeatedly confirmed that aspartame is safe for everyday consumption.”_

**How Many 500 ml Bottles Would Exceed the ADI?**

- **Coca-Cola Light** (~255 mg aspartame/bottle):

- **EU ADI** → ~**11 bottles** (2,805 mg)

- **U.S. ADI** → ~**14 bottles** (3,570 mg)

- **Coca-Cola Zero Sugar** (~175 mg aspartame/bottle):

- **EU ADI** → ~**16 bottles** (2,800 mg)

- **U.S. ADI** → ~**20 bottles** (3,500 mg)

> - **Does aspartame cause cancer?**
> 
> ==**Aspartame has been rigorously studied for over 40 years, with over 90 regulatory bodies, including the WHO, FDA, and EFSA, repeatedly confirming that it is safe for consumption within the recommended limits.”**
- _“The_**_Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)_**_is set at 40 mg/kg body weight in the EU and 50 mg/kg in the U.S., well below typical consumption levels.”_==
> 
> - What are the most significant health risks associated with aspartame consumption (particularly regarding cancer)?
> ==_“The WHO’s IARC placed aspartame in Group 2B (‘possibly carcinogenic’), but this means_**_ limited evidence _**_exists in humans and does not imply significant risk at normal intake levels.”_
 _“Coffee and pickled vegetables are also in Group 2B, yet no one considers them inherently unsafe.”_==
>     
> 
> - Do you think that people who consume artificial sweeteners on a daily basis have a higher chance of getting cancer?
> ==_“There’s_**_no conclusive evidence_**_showing a causal link between aspartame and cancer at standard daily intake levels. The FDA and EFSA both affirm this.”_==
>     
> - Do you think that with further research, more definitive evidence about negative health influence of aspartame and artificial sweeteners could be found?
>     
> - What is your opinion on using artificial sweeteners to improve weight loss, or to be included in fitness products to reduce sugar intake
> ==_“Aspartame plays a key role in_ **_low-calorie beverages_**_, helping consumers reduce sugar intake and manage their weight. Health organizations like the_ **_American Diabetes Association (ADA)_** _recognize its value for individuals seeking healthier choices.”_
> **Think about it** how many peope started with a fittness regiment only to fail because of sugars in fitness beverages== 

> [!tip] How is the public informed about aspartame?
>
> - Do you think the public is informed sufficiently about the possible risks of aspartame?
> ==_“There is room for improvement. Misleading headlines often sensationalize studies and create confusion, while regulatory conclusions—affirming aspartame’s safety—are overshadowed.”_
> Think also about, how much coca cola is demonized in the social media==
>    
> - How should the public be informed in your opinion?
>     ==_“Companies like Coca-Cola have a responsibility to provide_ **_transparent, science-based information_**_, which is why we share facts through product labels, official websites, and partnerships with independent research.”_==
> - Is social media a valid source of information regarding aspartame? Is misinformation an issue?
> ==_“Social media has both strengths and weaknesses. While it spreads information quickly, it also amplifies_ **_misinformation_**_, especially when influencers lack scientific literacy or proper disclosure.”_==
>     
> - Which recommendations would you give the public regarding aspartame use?
>  ==_“Aspartame is safe when consumed in moderation within the recommended daily limits. Trust_ **_reliable sources_**_, like regulatory agencies and peer-reviewed research.”_==
>     

> [!Significance] How can regulators ensure trust in food safety?
> - How do regulatory bodies reconcile conflicting evidence?
>    ==_“Regulators like the FDA and EFSA base their decisions on the_ **_totality of scientific evidence_**_—not on single studies. Rigorous reviews ensure findings are consistent and comprehensive.”_==
> - To what extent do industry lobbying efforts influence regulatory outcomes?
> ==_“Coca-Cola engages with policymakers transparently, following legal guidelines. Supporting research is not lobbying; it’s part of ensuring that decisions are grounded in sound science.”_==
>    
>- Should national regulations be stricter or more aligned with global standards?
> ==_“Harmonizing regulations globally helps avoid confusion and maintains public trust. Aligning with institutions like the WHO and EFSA ensures consistency.”_==

> [!Related] What substitutes can be used instead of aspartame?
> ==
> - Are substitutes of aspartame safe for use?
>     ==_“Other sweeteners like stevia, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium are approved and deemed safe by regulators. Each has its strengths and limitations.”_==
> - Are there any health issues that can be caused by aspartame substitutes?
>     ==_“No evidence suggests that approved sweeteners pose significant risks when consumed responsibly. Like aspartame, substitutes undergo thorough safety reviews.”_==
> - Do you think other substitutes are safer than aspartame?
>     ==_“Not necessarily. Aspartame has a_ **_longer safety record_**_, having been studied for decades, whereas newer alternatives have comparatively less data.”_==
> - Why is aspartame still used in Coca Cola production and not some other substitute?
> ==Long history of research==

- **Does coca cola do secret advertisement/marketing on social media**
Coca-Cola engages in influencer partnerships and social media campaigns to promote its products. While the company emphasizes transparency in its marketing efforts, there have been instances where the disclosure of sponsored content was not sufficiently clear, leading to concerns about covert advertising practices.

_We follow strict regulatory guidelines, including those set by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other authorities worldwide, to ensure that all sponsored content and partnerships are clearly disclosed._
