# Session_20241210

- [ ] Introduce names for the panelists
- [ ] Gear the themes more towards public audience (some of them are too scientific)
	- [ ] We need to place the organisations, abbreviations, amounts in context
- [ ] Introduction speech by the moderator to set the scene
- [ ] Substitutes theme needs a little more exclamation (either health effects or substitutes, both of them would be too much for this theme)
- [ ] Scientists are never neutral, science is not objective, this discussant should be fleshed out more precisely (what kind of scientist)

## Societal Actor

I found three potential partners from their list, they also have individual emails, Sarah Sorscher focuses on the regulatory aspects of e.g. food additives, so I think she would be great. Then there is Jessi Silverman who focuses more on dietary practices but also oversees advocacy campaigns. Then there is also Jeff Cronin as the director of communications, he communicates to the public and policy makers. I have made sure they are not scientists. Who do you guys think is best?
