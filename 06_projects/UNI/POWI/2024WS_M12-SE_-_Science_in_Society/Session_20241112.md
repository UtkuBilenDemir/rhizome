## Regulatory Issues 
- One major issue in artificial sweeteners, including aspartame, is their regulation. At the global level, this is a concern of the World Health Organisation (**WHO**)
- Within the European Union, artificial sweeteners are regulated by The European Food Safety Authority (**EFSA**),
- Each country also has local regulatory organizations, that follow the advice of superior authorities (in this case the World Health Organisation (WHO) and The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) like **AGES**

## Co2 Group
- Removal instead of avoidance, is it techno solutionism?
