## Presentation Narrative

Good morning, everyone.

In this presentation, I’ll be walking you through the **actor network map** our team created, focusing on **artificial sweeteners**, with a particular emphasis on **Aspartame**. We aimed to capture the entire landscape of the ongoing debates surrounding Aspartame. Instead of slides, I will use the sketchboard to familiarize you with the key **actors** and **connections** that shape this debate.​
### Intro
First of all, as you see, we got the main actor Aspartame in the middle of our mapping. I want to first talk about artificial sweeteners and aspartame a little bit. 
#### What Are Artificial Sweeteners?
**Artificial sweeteners** are synthetic sugar substitutes that offer sweetness similar to sugar but with fewer or no calories. They are used extensively in foods and beverages, especially in “diet” or “low-calorie” products. These sweeteners aim to provide sweetness without the added caloric load or other qualities of sugar.
#### What is Aspartame?
Among these sweeteners, **aspartame** is perhaps the most well-known, and also controversial. Chemically, it is composed of phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol, and was first approved for use in the 1980s. Aspartame is approximately **200 times sweeter than sugar** and is found in many products, such as diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and even some medications. Despite its widespread use, aspartame has been at the center of numerous health debates due to concerns over its safety.
#### Why Aspartame?
You might be wondering, why did we choose to focus specifically on aspartame? The answer is simple: **it is currently the most widely used artificial sweetener in the world**. Furthermore, aspartame has sparked a significant amount of public debate and scrutiny in recent years, particularly surrounding its potential health risks. This makes it a focal point for both the scientific community and consumers, and offers a rich landscape of actors around it.
#### What have we analysed so far? (Won't go into details)
Throughout our research, we have analyzed a variety of publications, reports, and debates surrounding Aspartame. Some of the key sources include:

- **Regulatory Reports** from leading organizations such as the **FDA**, **EFSA**, and the **WHO**. ~~These bodies provide comprehensive assessments on the safety and usage of Aspartame, often resulting in differing conclusions based on the same body of evidence. For instance, while the FDA maintains that Aspartame is safe, the WHO’s recent reevaluation points to potential hazards under specific conditions.~~

- **Industry Statements**, such as those from **Coca-Cola**, emphasize the safety of Aspartame within recommended limits. These statements highlight its role in reducing sugar intake and supporting healthier lifestyles.

- **Critical Research Papers**, including studies published in **2022 and 2023**, which focus on the health risks linked to Aspartame consumption. For example, one study found a 22% increased risk of cancer for high consumers of Aspartame, while another linked artificial sweeteners to a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes.

- **Media Debates**, ranging from traditional media outlets to social media platforms, particularly TikTok, where influencers have been paid to spread misinformation about Aspartame’s safety. This has contributed to public confusion and skepticism about its health effects.
### Actors, Statements, and Positions
This map provides a visual breakdown of the interactions between various stakeholders around this debate, I'll try to explain actors and categories one by one by strating with the more general categories. 

 We identified and grouped key actors into distinct categories, which are color-coded in our visual representation as the broadest categories. As you see as the most general categories, we have first the societal actors represented in **blue**, scientific actors represented in **pink**, commercial actors in **yellow**, and since the media is usually between the societal and scientific landscape and also very well engaged with the commercial ones, media is indicated with purple color.

On the deeper levels, I'll introduce finer categories and the individual actors. I cannot mention the whole landscape of the discourse, but I'll also note some of their statements regarding the debate around aspartame

1. **Regulatory Organizations**:
Regulatory bodies play a pivotal role in assessing the safety of Aspartame. Key organizations include the **FDA**, **EFSA** (European Food Safety Authority), and **WHO**. These institutions conduct ongoing risk assessments to ensure public health is safeguarded. For example, the **FDA** declared Aspartame safe for consumption within established limits, whereas the **WHO** recently reevaluated its safety, leading to a more cautious stance in certain reports. Additionally, bodies like **IARC** (International Agency for Research on Cancer) have examined its potential cancer risks.

**WHO**, **FDA**, and **EFSA** generally agree that **Aspartame is safe for consumption** within the daily intake limit of **40 mg/kg body weight**. These organizations cite studies that do not indicate any need for regulatory changes. The **FDA** has acknowledged studies suggesting potential carcinogenic risks but emphasizes that the data does not confirm risks at normal consumption levels.

2. **The Food and Beverage Industry**:
Major players in the food and beverage industry, such as **Coca-Cola**, are deeply involved in promoting the safety of Aspartame, as it is a vital component in many of their low-calorie and sugar-free products. The industry, through lobbying efforts, ensures that Aspartame remains a feasible sweetener, citing extensive research supporting its safety.

Companies like **Coca-Cola** and their lobby groups (e.g., **ICBA**) promote Aspartame as a safe, low-calorie alternative to sugar. However, some companies, like **Nutrasweet**, have started moving away from Aspartame, marketing plant-based alternatives like **neotame**.

3. **Research Institutes and Experts**:

Numerous research institutions and independent scientists have contributed to this ongoing discourse. Recent papers, such as the ones exploring Aspartame’s potential link to cancer and cardiovascular risks, suggest that heavy consumption may have adverse health effects. These studies, like the one from **NCBI** linking Aspartame to increased cancer risk or type 2 diabetes, provide a critical lens through which the sweetener is analyzed.

While most research institutions support Aspartame’s safety within regulatory limits, some experts, such as **Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian**, argue that there is insufficient data to prove Aspartame’s long-term safety. This highlights ongoing divisions in research methodology and interpretations of available data.

In 2023, the **IARC** categorized Aspartame as **“possibly carcinogenic” (Group 2B)**, igniting further debates on its safety. This classification has sparked discussions on whether stricter regulations should be imposed, despite no definitive link to cancer at recommended consumption levels.

4. **Media and Misinformation**:
The media also plays a significant role, shaping public perception. Traditional outlets and social media, including fitness influencers, have been platforms where misinformation about Aspartame has circulated. There are claims, especially on social media platforms like TikTok, that influencers are being paid to promote false narratives about Aspartame’s safety. This has caused confusion among consumers regarding the sweetener’s true health impact. In general, **traditional media** outlets tend to report both regulatory statements and studies critical of Aspartame, creating a dual narrative around its safety. **Social media**, particularly platforms like **TikTok**, has seen influencers spreading both accurate information and misinformation, contributing to public confusion.

5. **Consumer & Health Advocacy Groups**:
These groups, including obesity prevention organizations and consumer advisory groups, raise awareness about potential risks linked to artificial sweeteners. They call for more stringent regulations and transparent research, often countering the narratives promoted by industry-backed studies.

For example **The American Diabetes Association (ADA)** supports the use of Aspartame as a safer alternative to sugar, citing FDA-backed studies on its safety. In contrast, activist groups like **U.S. Right to Know (USRTK)** heavily criticize the additive, emphasizing studies that suggest links to cancer and other health risks.

### Relations

As you see, we have also used some distinct types of relations on the board. First relationship assesment we did was to find out which actor is more likely to have more influence, more power. The biggest influence comes from the regulatory organizations (like WHO on the global level or EFSA on EU-level). These organizations are responsible, after required research together with research institutes and experts, to establish the important data about artificial sweeteners, and if they are safe for use or not. Research institutes are directly related to regulatory organizations to carry out important data and also to have ongoing research to improve data. In the close cooperation with legal and policy actors, this data, which was lastly proven and established through regulatory organizations, will be put into the law of the state.

#### Direct Influences

Scientific Organisations -> **Regulatory Organisations**

Regulatory organisations (e.g., **WHO**, **EFSA**) collaborate with **research institutes** and **experts** to gather data on the safety of artificial sweeteners, including Aspartame. Research institutes generate the scientific data that regulatory bodies rely on for making informed decisions.

**Regulatory Organizations** -> **Food and Beverage Industry**

 Regulatory bodies influence **food and beverage companies** by determining which artificial sweeteners (like Aspartame) are allowed for use in food production. Companies like **Coca-Cola** must follow these regulatory guidelines when formulating their products.  ~~The production companies, like Coca Cola, are directly influenced by the regulatory organisations and also in close cooperation with them, so that food companies know which ingredients (in this case, different artificial sweeteners) are dependent on the allowance by these regulatory organisations.~~

**Regulatory Organizations** -> **Media**
Regulatory bodies should ideally have the most influence on the **media**, as they provide the scientifically backed data that forms the basis of public health information. However, the media is also influenced by other factors, including commercial interests.
**Food and Beverage Industry -> Media**
The **food and beverage industry** uses the **media** to promote their products. They influence the media through marketing campaigns and advertisements to shape public perceptions about the safety and benefits of Aspartame and similar sweeteners. They use different types of media to promote their products to as many people as possible. Different types of media (like newspapers or TV commercials) will be used for promotion, but since the last decade, the promotion through social media and social influencers has been hugely increased.
**Research Institutes** -> **Food and Beverage Industry**
 The research institutes and different experts have also huge influence on the media, which can sometimes lead to misinformation, especially when there are different researches with completely different information about the artificial sweeteners

**Media** -> **Consumers**
The biggest amount of consumers are directly influenced by different types of media, so it is very important that the news that is spread, is scientifically proven. Between consumers and beverage companies, there is a mutual connection, because  the companies produce the products, which are loved by the customers, and customers show their connections by buying these products. There are different health organizations and activist groups that are mostly influenced by media, research organizations, or different experts, depending on which stand they are representing. **This relationship goes further in bidirectional sense** because there is a prominent supply and demand chain going on. The Companies have to create a specific demand for these beverages etc. in order to keep going.

#### Indirect Influences

**Regulatory Organizations ↔ Consumers (via Legal and Policy Makers)**:

- **Regulatory bodies** like the FDA and EFSA indirectly influence **consumers** by working through **legal and policy makers**. These organizations ensure that only products tested and approved by regulators are allowed on the market. As a result, consumers are limited to purchasing products that meet regulatory standards, though they might not interact with these organizations directly.

 **Scientists and Experts ↔ Consumers (via Media)**:
 **Scientists and experts** also exert an indirect influence on **consumers**, but their findings are filtered through the **media**. Depending on how the media reports these scientific studies, consumers may receive mixed or conflicting information about the safety and risks of Aspartame and other sweeteners. This indirect flow of information can lead to confusion or misinformed decisions by the public.
