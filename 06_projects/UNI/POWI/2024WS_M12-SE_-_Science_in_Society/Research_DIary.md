# Research_DIary
- **The assumptions I make about my case are**
	- The artificial sweeteners are a topic whereas the interests of the market went way beyond the science itself. They shouldn't be this available before getting the research reight on them. Particularly aspartame seems to be underresearched before going into the market
- **Other Questions**
	- It was decided for me, so I had to play with the cards I was dealt with.
	- My opinions are not changed yet but challenged, I am trying to understand if aspartame is safe under a specific threshhold.
	- Most of the people might believe that these substances are researched enough.
	- Struggling with putting the perspecive of the industry into some legitimate argumentatiion line
	- Group work is going pretty good with responsive and active people, especially since their expertise is much closer to the subject.
