### Was ist "internet governance"

> **IGF**: Internet Governance Forum
> **WSIS**: World Summit on the Information Society
>> [!quote]- 2
> > On the other hand, the term ‘Internet governance’ is not normally applied to studies of many realworld activities that actually shape and regulate the way the Internet works. Interconnection agreements among Internet service providers (ISPs), routing arrangements, content filtering by national governments, or the control of spam, copyright infringement and botnets, for example, are not, for the most part, grouped under the field label.

> > Malcolm (2008) has convincingly argued that the definition casts a wide conceptual net to include hierarchy, network and market governance mechanisms. Yet even he boils down the phenomenon under study to an organogram that includes the usual suspects – the ICANN, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) – but none of the actors that actually coordinate to operate the Internet, such as ISPs, search engines, cloud operators or e-commerce providers (Malcolm, 2008: 39). Malcolm’s approach typifies the current practice in the field.

> We perceive this as an interesting puzzle. Common to all definitions of governance is a notion of steering. The United Nations Working Group on Internet Governance defined Internet governance as ‘the development and application by governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the Internet’ (WGIG, 2005).

### Die Felder (Bereiche?) des "internet governance"

> [!quote]+ 3: Felder des "internet governance"
> 1) Internet governance; 
> 2) telecommunications policy; 
> 3) information security economics; 
> 4) cyberlaw.
#### 1. Internet Governance

**ICANN**: The ICANN was a unilateral construction of a global regime by the United States, and was based on a new, non-governmental model. This innovation prompted the development of a research literature that critically assessed the ICANN as an institution (Froomkin, 2000, 2003; Hofmann, 2005; Mueller, 2002; Palfrey, 2004; Pommerening, 2004). A related strand of research focuses on the organizations that have been delegated the responsibility to manage the Top Level Domains, most notably the country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) (Christou and Simpson, 2009; McDowell et al., 2008; Park, 2008).

**WSIS**: The next step in the evolution of the field was prompted by the United Nations’ WSIS – a state-centric series of diplomatic conferences held from 2002 to 2005. The WSIS provided a platform for developing country governments and the European Union to challenge the pre-eminence of the United States;

> [!quote]+ 5: Broader def.
> That broader definition noted that these shared processes involve not just governments but business and civil society as well, which both ratified the position of non-state actors in Internet governance and put practically all of the traditional problems of communication and information policy within its frame. Moreover, in the actual politics of the WSIS, the activities of the ICANN (focused on the domain name space and internet protocol (IP) address space) were often conflated with governance of the entire Internet (IGP, 2005).

> [!important] DNS
> Managing the Domain Name System (DNS) is only one narrow function within a much larger set of activities that shapes the evolution and use of the Internet. In performing this function, the role of the ICANN is important but limited, because of the heavily decentralized infrastructure underlying the DNS. 
>> [!tip] introduce Gallpway

> The field that designates itself as Internet governance is highly interdisciplinary: it includes work from the perspective of institutional economics, political science and international relations, communication and information studies, sociology, and law. However, most of the work in this field falls into three categories: (a) policy and institutional analysis of the ICANN and the Regional Internet Address Registries; (b) explorations of various aspects of the WSIS and the IGF; and (c) broader, meta-discussions of global governance as it applies to the Internet, especially multi-stakeholderism and the relationship between private sector self-governance and intergovernmental organizations.

#### 2. Telecommunications policy

> [!quote]+ 6
> This field encompasses policy-oriented research on telecommunications and the electronic mass media. It emerged as an interdisciplinary field early in the 1970s, when the growing importance of communications infrastructure made it necessary to examine law, technology and economics in an integrated fashion (Owen, 2002).

#### 3. Information security economics

> [!quote]+ 6
> ˝Since about 2001 an interdisciplinary literature has attempted to synthesize knowledge of computer science and information systems with the insights of economics to study problems of cybersecurity. The new field, which designates itself as information security economics, is based on the insight that the Internet’s security problems are not simply technical but are driven by the economic incentives of actors and firms. (Anderson and Moore, 2006; Moore et al., 2009).
> [...]
> In this literature, the term ‘security’ means exactly what it does in mainstream international relations research (Deibert and Rohozinski, 2010). It deals with ‘cyberwar’ or Internet-based attacks on one state by another, the use of the Internet by terrorist groups, and the threat to critical infrastructures that might be posed through network vulnerabilities (Arquilla and Ronfelt, 2001).

#### 4. Cyberlaw

> [!quote]+ 7
> The field of cyberlaw provides the most complex and mixed case. Cyberlaw is a field that developed along with the Internet, and many of its key scholars seem to have conceived of their work as part of a discourse on Internet governance, broadly speaking.
> 1. those who do use the Internet governance label typically do so in the context of discussions of the ICANN.
> 2. since those early days the cyberlaw literature has expanded into a far more extensive treatment of the legal, policy and legislative issues associated with the relationship between law and cyberspace.
> focuses on copyright, privacy and censorship in cyberspace. The literature on copyright often deals with transnational problems, such as free software, the battle over peer-to-peer file sharing and international institutions such as the World Intellectual Property Organization (De Beer and Clemmer, 2009; Litman, 2001; Samuelson, 1996; Urban and Quilter, 2006). An equally large body of cyberlaw literature deals with controversies and technologies associated with privacy (Solove, 2007; Zimmer, 2008).

#### Warum sind die anderen Felder nicht als "internet governance" kennzeichnet 
All of the fields are interdisciplinary and there is substantial disciplinary overlap across them. The literature review reveals a distinctive fact pattern. The field designator ‘Internet governance’ is strongly linked to research on the ICANN, ccTLDs, the WSIS and the IGF. The three other fields deal extensively with issues that strongly affect Internet governance, yet only one of them (Cyberlaw) explicitly uses the term Internet governance

> [!quote]- 8: Jonathan Zittrain (2008), entitled ‘The Future of the Internet – And How to Stop It
> A quick summary of its argument is that the security problems currently plaguing the Internet may trigger a set of technical and economic reactions that will fundamentally change the way the Internet is governed and by whom, destroying its power of innovation in the process. A book could hardly address the governance of the Internet more directly.

Even the book above does not include the term "internet governance"

> [!question] 8:WHY
> 1.  **global governance perspetive assumption**: participants in the Internet governance field take a distinctively global governance perspective on the topic. They look at the Internet holistically as a globally interoperable system and think of governance as something characteristic of it as a system. Participants in the telecommunication policy and cyberlaw fields, in contrast, are more rooted in national perspectives, or in specific bodies of law that are still statecentric, even if some of them are international in nature.
> 2. **overarching institute perspective overlooks the decentralised decisions assumption(galloway, protocol)** Global governance of the Internet, in this view, must be associated with clearly identified institutional venues where people come together for collective action and Internet governance is explicitly the topic of discussion. Thus, venues such as the ICANN, the Regional Internet Address Registries, the WSIS or the IGF become valorized as the key sites of Internet governance.
> 3. **illusion of openness**: A third assumption is the idea that if one formally designates a venue for Internet governance and makes it open to all stakeholders, then it constitutes a form of Internet governance – regardless of how much actual authority over Internet operations its participants have. A corollary assumption is that a formally designated venue for Internet governance discussions will automatically include all relevant players in Internet governance. This perspective seems to be rooted in an idealistic notion of governance based on participatory democracy norms and ideas of multi-stakeholderism. It ignores the strategic decisions actors make about what venues they will participate in and which ones they will ignore, avoid or boycott. In some extreme cases of this assumption, there is practically an equation of governance with discourse about governance. The UN IGF, for example, is assumed to be relevant to the governance of the Internet because that is where people come together to talk about Internet governance. This obscures the rather painful fact that most of the actors with operational control over Internet resources are absent from it – except, once again, the ICANN.

#### Blinde Flecken: Was ist der Hauptfaktor, das es verursacht?

> [!quote] 9: Weil es viel einfacher ist
> Why have Internet governance researchers failed to acknowledge that most governance is taking place elsewhere and adapt their approaches accordingly? The short answer is because their myopic focus has certain advantages. For empirical work, studying a centralized institution is a lot more convenient than having to identify and study a wealth of disjointed, messy and globally distributed processes that together produce governance. The interactions of people and stakeholders at the ICANN or IGF meetings around, say, security are much easier to observe than the interactions among thousands of ISPs in their daily fights against botnets and spam.
> In addition, formalized institutions have explicit rules and procedures. This renders the object of study readily available for (certain types of) empirical analysis. In virtually all other areas of the Internet, relevant rules and procedures are often informal and thus more difficult to identify.
> **again the openness illusion**: these researchers have confined themselves to asking questions about the institutions themselves and the way they work, rather than about actual governance. For example, there are numerous studies of civil society participation in the WSIS, of how state and non-state actors share power in the IGF, and of the ICANN’s structure and processes (Froomkin, 2003; Klein, 2004; Kleinwachter, 2004b; Koppell, 2005; Palfrey, 2004; Pavane and Diani, 2008). In other words, the field assumes Internet governance to take place at these institutions and then asks questions about the institutions themselves, rather than conceptualizing Internet governance and studying where and how it is actually taking place.

> [!quote] 10: Governments are also deceived
> Governments, for reasons similar to those of academic researchers, have developed the same focus. The attempt by China and some Arab states to make the IGF more statecentric, or to have the intergovernmental ITU take over the ICANN’s functions, reveals the same myopia. This happens because centralized and formalized institutions are amenable to the repertoire of state power. For governments – as for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders – there seem to be no other institutions they can address with their concerns, hold accountable where needed and propose to reform when their objectives are not being met. Given the increasing importance of the Internet to our societies, there is a growing need for accountability and some semblance of control over this critical infrastructure. This need is channeled into an almost desperate focus on the few institutional straws at which to clutch.

#### Eine neue Definition ist notwendig
> [!quote] 11f: Outlook
> The implication seems clear: the study of these formalized institutions that are officially designated as sites of ‘Internet governance’ presents us with a biased sample. Focusing exclusively on them would lead us to overestimate the presence and influence of states in Internet governance.
> Clearly, use of the label ‘Internet governance’ needs to be re-thought and changed. The field would benefit greatly from expanding to include innovative areas such as the economics of cybersecurity, network neutrality, content filtering and regulation, copyright policing and file sharing, and interconnection arrangements among ISPs.
> Ideally, the conceptualization would accommodate the diversity of governance on the Internet, from centralized, formal global institutions such as the ICANN all the way to the emergent order that arises from the interactions among thousands of ISPs and their users. It would also be able to conceptualize governance in environments with low formalization, heterogeneous organizational forms, large numbers of actors and massively distributed authority and decision-making power.

The conditions we described as applicable to Internet governance – low formalization, heterogeneous organizational forms, large numbers of actors and massively distributed decision-making power – usually point to market and network governance. Market governance can facilitate interactions among large numbers of autonomous actors without the need for collective agreements, although it does require some kind of mutual recognition of property rights and media of exchange. Areas that rely heavily on the use of contracts, such as ISP interconnection arrangements, seem to fit with this model.

However, in other areas of Internet governance, formal contracting or market exchanges are not the dominant force. Internet security governance, for example, often relies on networks of collaboration. The interpersonal and inter-organizational networks among security professionals that provide incident response and abuse management conform to the conventional understanding of network governance, in which trust, reputation and reciprocity are critical elements (Powell, 1990). A group of legal scholars (Johnson et al., 2004) have advanced a model of Internet security governance through the use of disconnection or ‘ostracism’ by ISPs as an alternative to more hierarchical exercises of regulatory power that might damage the Internet’s innovative and open nature.
## [[@hofmann2016]] Multi-stakeholderism in Internet governance: putting a fiction into practice - Jeanette Hofmann

> [!qutoe]+ 29: Background of the multi-stakeholderism
> As a term, multi-stakeholder is a rather recent invention and has not been around for much longer than two decades. As an organising principle and a political practice, however, multi-actor arrangements have a long tradition. A prominent example is the tripartite composition of the International Labour Organization, a UN agency founded in 1919, comprising governments, employers and workers. The common idea behind these tripartite constellations is to aggregate the diversity of political concerns and backgrounds into identifiable groups, which ideally negotiate consensual rules or recommendations that are accepted as legitimate by all those affected, regardless of whether or not they directly participated in the process.

> [!quote] 31: Entstehung
> The term multi-stakeholder was coined in the 1990s and gained broader traction after the turn of the century. Interestingly, it has emerged simultaneously in the political context of the UN World Summits and in the academic context of management theory. Responding to rising social concerns over environmental problems, the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development started institutionalising new forms of collaboration between governmental and non-governmental groups, and has therefore been associated with the ‘participatory turn’ of global governance (Bäckstrand 2006b, 470).

### Imaginary inherent to the political spheres

> [!quote]- 30
> All authors, not just poets, offer a discursive representation of reality that uses fictional techniques to ‘pass as a plausible account of the “way things really are”’ (White 1978, 122). In so doing, both novelists and academics have to meet the criteria of ‘correspondence’. The story they tell has to be ‘“adequate” as an image of something beyond itself’ (White 1978, 122). In a similar vein, Ezrahi (2012, 149) argues that there is a ‘fictional layer’ inherent in all political regimes. Fictions are part of the ‘political imaginaries’ (2012, 3).1 Imaginaries shape our perceptions, expectations and behaviour, and they allow us to experience fictions as facts.
> [...]
> to correspond to the imaginary’ (Ezrahi 2012, 4). Contrary to its often pejorative use in a political context, Ezrahi insists that fictions are a necessity of the political space, and that the common division between the fictitious and the real should be seen in itself as a result of modern imagination: ‘It is precisely this dichotomy between facts and fictions that ( ... ) has also obscured the unique potential of the imaginary to be both fact and fiction’ (Ezrahi 2012, 7).
> 

> [!quote] 30: But fiction enhances the legitimacy
> 1. Following White (1978) and Ezrahi (2012), this article assumes that the multi-stakeholder concept is an imaginary that provides meaning and regularity to a fragmented, disorderly world. It displays the Internet governance landscape in a coherent and legitimacy-enhancing fashion. However, the multi-stakeholder narrative does not only represent reality, it also gives rise to expectations, objectives, new categories and benchmarks.
> 2. A second assumption of this article, therefore, is that the multi-stakeholder concept is performative. To the extent that the actors in Internet governance identify with its tale of inclusion, diversity and bottom-up policymaking, they strive to make it a reality. It is the effort of implementing the multi-stakeholder fiction, in Ezrahi’s(201, 2 165) terms ‘bringing the fiction closer to reality’, which is at the centre of this article. I want to show how organisations accommodate and operationalise the concept, in other words, how they struggle to achieve the impossible: to fully qualify as multi-stakeholder bodies.
### Conclusion

this article has argued that the multi-stakeholder concept is a discursive artefact that aims to smooth contradictory and messy practices into a coherentstoryaboutcollaborative transnational policymaking.

Ezrahi (2007, referring to Giambattista Vico) would call a a ‘publicly “believable impossibility”’

and a strong focus on procedures protects this mantra against clashes with reality. Hence, defining multi-stakeholderism as a constellation of actors, issues and modes of governance, as many authors do, is only half the story. The other half consists of fiction, a romantic plot hoping for a happy ending.

In closing, a few words about the practical implications of these findings. It would certainly be a misunderstanding to assume that disappointing fictions can simply be dismissed and buried. As both White and Ezrahi point out, fictions are necessary elements in making sense of and engaging with the world. There is no political practice or discourse that does not resort to imaginaries as a means of relating the local and the present to broader developments and structures of the past or the future. However, as a brief review of the origins of the multi-stakeholder concept has shown, fictions are by no means intrinsically static. They emerge in, and adapt to, specific contexts; even their basic messages are open to debate and change. Because fictions have a history and always compete against other fictions they encourage critical reflection. Thus, there is problem when this critical reflection no longer takes place, or is only tolerated at the fringes, and when fictions become static and begin resembling a religion. In this spirit, a measured ‘desecration’ of the multi-stakeholder approach in Internet governance which could facilitate a debate about achievements, failures and its reasons would be a positive effect.

### 2.1 Internet Governance: Definition

> [!Presenter Note] 2
> Wie die neuen Studien davon ewähnen, gibt es eine zweiseitige Reflektion auf die Rolle vom Staat bei den globalen Kommunikationsnetzwerken. Also, manche behaupten, dass der Staat nie marginalisiert, und schon immer ein starker Spieler geblieben war. Die wahrgenommene Marginalisierung des Staates auf dem globalen Netzwerk war nur eine Aberglaube von den Menschen, dass die globalen Netzwerke die Autonomität von den Staaten reduzieren sollte. Und anere Authoren glauben, dass der Staat vielleicht am Amnfang kurz ausgeschlossen geblieben waren, aber sie haben sich schnell an die neuen Technologien adaptiert. Nun haben sie einen starken Einfluss und Kontrolle über Internet.

### 1. Internet Governance

**ICANN**: The ICANN was a unilateral construction of a global regime by the United States, and was based on a new, non-governmental model. This innovation prompted the development of a research literature that critically assessed the ICANN as an institution (Froomkin, 2000, 2003; Hofmann, 2005; Mueller, 2002; Palfrey, 2004; Pommerening, 2004). A related strand of research focuses on the organizations that have been delegated the responsibility to manage the Top Level Domains, most notably the country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) (Christou and Simpson, 2009; McDowell et al., 2008; Park, 2008).

**WSIS**: The next step in the evolution of the field was prompted by the United Nations’ WSIS – a state-centric series of diplomatic conferences held from 2002 to 2005. The WSIS provided a platform for developing country governments and the European Union to challenge the pre-eminence of the United States;

> 3. **illusion of openness**: A third assumption is the idea that if one formally designates a venue for Internet governance and makes it open to all stakeholders, then it constitutes a form of Internet governance – regardless of how much actual authority over Internet operations its participants have. A corollary assumption is that a formally designated venue for Internet governance discussions will automatically include all relevant players in Internet governance. This perspective seems to be rooted in an idealistic notion of governance based on participatory democracy norms and ideas of multi-stakeholderism. It ignores the strategic decisions actors make about what venues they will participate in and which ones they will ignore, avoid or boycott. In some extreme cases of this assumption, there is practically an equation of governance with discourse about governance. The UN IGF, for example, is assumed to be relevant to the governance of the Internet because that is where people come together to talk about Internet governance. This obscures the rather painful fact that most of the actors with operational control over Internet resources are absent from it – except, once again, the ICANN.

### Blinde Flecken: Was ist der Hauptfaktor, das es verursacht?

> [!quote] 9: Weil es viel einfacher ist
> Why have Internet governance researchers failed to acknowledge that most governance is taking place elsewhere and adapt their approaches accordingly? The short answer is because their myopic focus has certain advantages. For empirical work, studying a centralized institution is a lot more convenient than having to identify and study a wealth of disjointed, messy and globally distributed processes that together produce governance. The interactions of people and stakeholders at the ICANN or IGF meetings around, say, security are much easier to observe than the interactions among thousands of ISPs in their daily fights against botnets and spam.
> In addition, formalized institutions have explicit rules and procedures. This renders the object of study readily available for (certain types of) empirical analysis. In virtually all other areas of the Internet, relevant rules and procedures are often informal and thus more difficult to identify.
> **again the openness illusion**: these researchers have confined themselves to asking questions about the institutions themselves and the way they work, rather than about actual governance. For example, there are numerous studies of civil society participation in the WSIS, of how state and non-state actors share power in the IGF, and of the ICANN’s structure and processes (Froomkin, 2003; Klein, 2004; Kleinwachter, 2004b; Koppell, 2005; Palfrey, 2004; Pavane and Diani, 2008). In other words, the field assumes Internet governance to take place at these institutions and then asks questions about the institutions themselves, rather than conceptualizing Internet governance and studying where and how it is actually taking place.

> [!quote] 10: Governments are also deceived
> Governments, for reasons similar to those of academic researchers, have developed the same focus. The attempt by China and some Arab states to make the IGF more statecentric, or to have the intergovernmental ITU take over the ICANN’s functions, reveals the same myopia. This happens because centralized and formalized institutions are amenable to the repertoire of state power. For governments – as for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders – there seem to be no other institutions they can address with their concerns, hold accountable where needed and propose to reform when their objectives are not being met. Given the increasing importance of the Internet to our societies, there is a growing need for accountability and some semblance of control over this critical infrastructure. This need is channeled into an almost desperate focus on the few institutional straws at which to clutch.

### Eine neue Definition ist notwendig
> [!quote] 11f: Outlook
> The implication seems clear: the study of these formalized institutions that are officially designated as sites of ‘Internet governance’ presents us with a biased sample. Focusing exclusively on them would lead us to overestimate the presence and influence of states in Internet governance.
> Clearly, use of the label ‘Internet governance’ needs to be re-thought and changed. The field would benefit greatly from expanding to include innovative areas such as the economics of cybersecurity, network neutrality, content filtering and regulation, copyright policing and file sharing, and interconnection arrangements among ISPs.
> Ideally, the conceptualization would accommodate the diversity of governance on the Internet, from centralized, formal global institutions such as the ICANN all the way to the emergent order that arises from the interactions among thousands of ISPs and their users. It would also be able to conceptualize governance in environments with low formalization, heterogeneous organizational forms, large numbers of actors and massively distributed authority and decision-making power.

The conditions we described as applicable to Internet governance – low formalization, heterogeneous organizational forms, large numbers of actors and massively distributed decision-making power – usually point to market and network governance. Market governance can facilitate interactions among large numbers of autonomous actors without the need for collective agreements, although it does require some kind of mutual recognition of property rights and media of exchange. Areas that rely heavily on the use of contracts, such as ISP interconnection arrangements, seem to fit with this model.

However, in other areas of Internet governance, formal contracting or market exchanges are not the dominant force. Internet security governance, for example, often relies on networks of collaboration. The interpersonal and inter-organizational networks among security professionals that provide incident response and abuse management conform to the conventional understanding of network governance, in which trust, reputation and reciprocity are critical elements (Powell, 1990). A group of legal scholars (Johnson et al., 2004) have advanced a model of Internet security governance through the use of disconnection or ‘ostracism’ by ISPs as an alternative to more hierarchical exercises of regulatory power that might damage the Internet’s innovative and open nature.

### 2.4 Multistakeholder-Ansatz: Die Entstehung
Der Multistakeholder-Ansatz hat seine Wurzeln im sogenannten "Participatory turn", der in den 1990er Jahren begann. Diese Entwicklung wurde maßgeblich durch die UN-Konferenz für Umwelt und Entwicklung vorangetrieben, die eine verstärkte Einbindung von Nichtregierungsorganisationen (NGOs) in die globale Governance forderte. Eine zentrale Idee hinter diesem Ansatz ist die Stakeholder-Theorie, die eine breitere Palette von Teilnehmern als nur die Eigentümer und Aktionäre in die Unternehmensstruktur einbezieht. Dies bedeutet den Ersatz von manageriellen Monologen durch multilaterale Dialoge, wodurch die Macht nicht mehr klar zentralisiert ist, sondern bei verschiedenen Interessengruppen liegt.

Dieser Ansatz fand Anwendung in komplexen, internationalen Fragestellungen wie beim Forest Stewardship Council, der Global Reporting Initiative und der World Commission on Dams zwischen 1998 und 2000. Das Ziel war die Entwicklung konsensbasierter, nicht bindender Richtlinien, die als Benchmarks dienen sollten. Diese Prozesse trugen zur Schaffung eines "globalen Blickwinkels" auf Probleme bei und hatten eine zunehmende Bedeutung in der globalen Governance.

Sie füllten regulatorische Lücken in der globalen Politikgestaltung und markierten einen Übergang zu einem "post-souveränen und partizipativen Regierungsmodell". Der Multistakeholder-Ansatz war eine Reaktion auf internationale Herausforderungen, die über die herkömmliche intergouvernementale Diplomatie hinausgingen, und führte zur Bildung "globaler, inchoativer Institutionen", die durch polyarchische Autoritätsbeziehungen charakterisiert sind.

Dieser evolutionäre Prozess zeigt die zunehmende Bedeutung und Komplexität der Multistakeholder-Governance in einer globalisierten Welt.

#### 2.5 Multistakeholder-Ansatz: “The Fiction of Global View”

### **Multistakeholder-Ansatz: Die Entstehung**: 

 > [!info]- 31: Context
  >  The term multi-stakeholder was coined in the 1990s and gained broader traction after the turn of the century. Interestingly, it has emerged simultaneously in the political context of the UN World Summits and in the academic context of management theory. Responding to rising social concerns over environmental problems, the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development started institutionalising new forms of collaboration between governmental and non-governmental groups, and has therefore been associated with the ‘participatory turn’ of global governance (Bäckstrand 2006b, 470).	
  >  In his seminal work (Freeman), he argued that not only owners and shareholders, but also a much broader array of social actors are important for corporations. The general criticism of Freeman’s approach was that, by centring on the corporation, stakeholder theory implicitly suggested that managers are the ‘master of their stakeholder interaction’
  >  Calton and Kurland (1996, 170) suggested moving the focus to multiple stakeholders: ‘Our theory “decenters” organizational discourse by replacing privileged managerial monologues with multilateral stakeholder dialogues. ( ... ) **There is no clear center of power; rather, power is located in multiple stakeholders**.’
  >  Towards the end of the 1990s, the term began spreading across transnational policy domains, and also came to denote efforts of private regulation, for instance in the form of standard setting or reporting. Iconic examples are the Forest Stewardship Council (founded in 1993), the Global Reporting Initiative (founded in 1997) and the World JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 3
  >  Commission on Dams (1998–2000).2 In each case, the starting point was a complex controversial issue on an international scale. They also share the goal of negotiating a consensual understanding of the situation, and developing non-binding guidelines or standards to serve as benchmarks for an industry or sector. To this end, they set out developing what Boström and Tamm Hallström (2013, 105) call a ‘global view’
  >  With a little time lag, the multi-stakeholder concept began fanning out in broader academic literature, where it acquired additional layers of meaning.3 For example, global governance studies adopted the term and used it for novel forms of ‘post-sovereign’ global governance (Bäckstrand 2006a, 290) and participatory democracy (Faysse 2006). According to this school of thought, multi-stakeholder networks fill the ‘regulatory voids’ of global policymaking (Fransen and Kolk 2007, 668) and offer a response to the increasing number of international problems that ‘intergovernmental diplomacy alone cannot grapple with’
  
   Stakeholder Theory: Aber Freeman's Definition noch immer beinhaltet die Behauptung, dass der OWner noch immer eine herrschende Rolle spielt, alle andere sind zusätzlich und marginal dabei. Dieses Verständnis wird auch mit der Zeit verändert...

> Multi-stakeholder initiatives are ascribed the potential to create new forms of transnational ‘stakeholder democracy’ including a relocation of policy authority to ‘public–private implementation networks’ (Bäckstrand 2006a, 291). The notion of stakeholder democracy, defined as ‘participatory, non-electoral and non-territorial forms of democracy at the global level’
> Summarising this line of argument, Moog, Spicer, and Böhm (2014, 473) point out that a deliberate representation of a wide range of perspectives may induce actors to change their views on a given issue and thus ‘contribute to organizational learning, pushing actors beyond narrow self-interest based bargaining’. On the whole, the literature attests to a great potential in multi-stakeholderism to fix the shortcomings of multilateral regulation, and for democratising the transnational sphere.
> Multi-stakeholder efforts are expected to prove and ensure that they are inclusive and diverse, transparent and accountable, that they do indeed balance conflicting interests, and that the work they do is good, if not qualitatively better than that of more traditional organisations against which they may compete.

> [!quote] Enttäuschungen
> In others, multi-stakeholder processes suffer from legitimacy problems, for instance because they are ‘North driven’, or because they are lacking grass root participation (Bäckstrand 2006a, 299). Moreover, it is not always clear if the outcomes actually result from multi-stakeholder processes. As Fransen and Kolk (2007, 678–679) observe, the term is poorly defined, and leaves ample space for interpretation so that even consultation processes or advisory roles, regardless of their impact on the ultimate policy outcome, may be portrayed as multi-stakeholder (see also Bäckstrand 2006a; Raymond and DeNardis 2015).
> As a rule, private sector members and public administrations have more resources at their disposal than civil society organisations. This concerns funding, but expertise and organisational capacity equally so `. **Particularly in countries where social and economic inequality are very pronounced, continuous participation by local civil society groups is difficult to achieve**.
> Resource imbalances are aggravated **by a constant need for recognition and legitimacy.** 

### Multistakeholder Ansatz: Prozess

- **WSIS**: Following WSIS, the multi-stakeholder concept rapidly spread, and began influencing the discourse among Internet governance organisations. Today, the multi-stakeholder approach denotes a broad range of organisational models and processes (Raymond and DeNardis 2015, 14).
- **WGIG**: used the term, and related it to ‘policy dialogue’; a different approach compared to the more outcome-oriented notions common in other policy fields. WGIG found that existing Internet governance mechanisms lacked the conditions necessary for ‘effective and meaningful participation of all stakeholders’, and presented the multi-stakeholder concept as a third option, or middle ground, between the contested alternatives of private versus public regulation of the Internet, which had paralysed large parts of the WSIS negotiations (Musiani and Pohle 2014, 4).
- **IGF**: The epitome of the multi-stakeholder approach in the digital domain is the IGF. Mandated by WSIS and founded in 2006, the IGF constitutes the first global space for ‘multi-stakeholder policy dialogue’. It is an annual conference embedded in preparatory meetings, intersessional activities and a growing number of national and regional offspring.
---
- **ICANN**: is a US-based non-profit corporation tasked with regulating the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. Paper issued by the US Department of Commerce (DOC), which stipulated that DNS policies should be developed by a private governance model independent of government control (DOC 1998).

> [!info]+ ICANN
> The political concerns relating to the DNS are diverse and rather polarised. They range from trademark holders wanting to see their assets in (brand) names protected, to civil liberty groups advocating respect of freedom of speech, privacy and other human rights. ICANN’s strategy to cope with this challenge was to provide an institutional home for each stakeholder or interest group considered relevant, and to aggregate these stakeholder groups into larger structures. These larger entities are divided into policymaking bodies with voting rights, the so-called supporting organisations, and advisory committees without voting rights (but other means of ensuring that their views are taken into account). Consensus on policy proposals is to be reached through majority voting in the supporting organisations.
> Since the White Paper established the imperative of global representation, no operational standards have been developed that would define the concept, recommend ways to implement it or justify discarding it altogether. The goal of global representativeness has probably never been officially questioned. Instead, it has given rise to nebulous concepts such as the ‘global ICANN community’, for which an enormous number of resources are mobilised annually to demonstrate the representation of ‘Internet users around the globe’.7 Thus, the imaginary of global representation inherent in the multi-stakeholder approach does impact ICANN in many ways: it drives and justifies its organisational evolution, including the continuous critique of its stakeholder balance, it creates performance metrics such as ‘globalised ICANN functions’8 and related budgets, and it keeps the idea alive that a ‘global view’ on issues is indeed possible. Fictions, as Ezrahi (2012, 3) points out, ‘acquire the power to regulate and shape political behavior and institutions’.
> 
> 
> The overarching goal was the transition of the DNS from a publicly funded service to a market-based, commercial service. This included establishing and regulating a market for allocating domain names, enabling and regulating competition between top-level domains (TLDs), a

>the Universal Dispute Resolution Policy.20 Furthermore, it created an accreditation system for registrars of domain names under .com, .org and .net.21 Yet introducing a general procedure for establishing new TLDs, arguably the most controversial of its tasks, proved to be much more difficult.

1. **Regulatory Authority Role:**
    
    - Transition DNS from publicly funded to market-based service.
    - Establish and regulate a market for domain name allocation.
    - Enable competition among top-level domains (TLDs).
    - Create a low-cost, swift dispute resolution system as an alternative to lawsuits.
2. **Achievements and Challenges:**
    
    - Implemented Universal Dispute Resolution Policy and an accreditation system for domain registrars by 1999.
    - Faced significant challenges in introducing a procedure for new TLDs; took nearly a decade to establish the New gTLD Programme.
    - Established a dense network of contracts regulating a significant portion of DNS space, reflecting the negotiation power of different parties.
3. **Policy and Scope of Regulation:**
    
    - Despite ICANN’s narrow mission focused on DNS coordination, its activities extend to enforcing copyright provisions and other legal issues.
    - Critics point to a "mission creep," with regulatory activities that go beyond technical DNS management.

**Slide 2: Criticisms and Policy Impacts of ICANN**

1. **Bias and Discrepancies in Policy Implementation:**
    
    - Stakeholders express concerns over ICANN's biased policy-making, favoring certain groups over others.
    - The non-commercial constituency is often seen as having little influence on policy outcomes.
2. **Challenges in New TLD Program:**
    
    - The introduction of new TLDs has been controversial and complex, reflecting the concerns of trademark holders and governments.
    - The application process for new TLDs is complex, expensive, and potentially disadvantaging for less resourceful applicants.
3. **Regulatory Impact and Stakeholder Influence:**
    
    - ICANN’s contractual web creates a bottom-heavy regulatory environment, intricate and cumbersome, similar to statutory regulations.
    - The power imbalances between stakeholders reflect the challenges and pressures similar to those faced by public regulatory authorities.
4. **Reflection on Multi-Stakeholder Model:**
    
    - Despite the intended benefits of the multi-stakeholder model, it faces criticisms for not producing more consensual or beneficial outcomes globally.
    - Belief in the model's superiority remains strong among the global ICANN community, influencing collective values and expectations despite evident shortcomings.

> [!info]+ IGF
> The IGF is the first organisation in Internet governance whose founding was explicitly based on the multi-stakeholder principle. The Tunis Agenda (WSIS 2005), the outcome document of WSIS, stated that the IGF should ‘build on the complementarity between all stakeholders involved’ in Internet governance, and it named them in line with the categories used throughout the WSIS process: ‘governments, business entities, civil society and intergovernmental organisations’. Compared to the rather complex stakeholder constellation of ICANN, this classification appears rather clear-cut and simple. However, from the outset, the stakeholders expressed uneasiness and dissent about these categories. Civil society and the technical sector, for example, criticised the UN stakeholder taxonomy for misrepresenting them, and asked for separate categories (Malcolm 2008, 365). The classification scheme matters to the stakeholders because it determines the distribution of seats in various committees and on workshop panels, and, to some extent, it shapes their identity and voice in the public discourse on Internet governance.
> 
> The final slate is a ‘black boxed’ result of consultations between the IGF secretariat and the UN headquarters. Considering itself underand, at times, misrepresented, civil society has called for more autonomy in the selection process. Yet, the contributing civil society groups are themselves only a small subset of all NGOs worldwide, which theoretically could nominate candidates for the MAG (UNCTAD 2015, 175).
> 
> ecalling the enormous effort of making the stakeholder taxonomy work within the IGF, Mueller (2010, 114) notes that ‘the seemingly simple act of bringing people from government, business, and civil society together for nonbinding dialogue about policy can be intensely political’. The stakeholders have spent ‘countless hours’ on holding the stakeholder groups together and negotiating the boundaries between them, a struggle that Mueller characterises as ‘politics of representation’ (Mueller 2010, 114–116).
>
>the stakeholder model ‘may foster diversity of standpoints but does not guarantee diversity of interests and does not impede double representation of the same interest’. The case of the IGF demonstrates that the stakeholder model does not constitute a natural representation of global actors, opinions or perspectives. Rather, it requires a lot of effort to make it work, and ‘enacting multi-stakeholderism’ (Epstein 2012) has caused recurring frictions within the IGF. 
>A significant part of muli-stakeholder collaboration in the IGF is devoted to implementing the fiction of global representation through the never-ending recreation of the stakeholder scheme.
**Slide 1: Mandate and Challenges of the IGF**

1. **Mandate Overview:**
    
    - The Tunis Agenda (WSIS 2005) mandates the IGF to discuss, facilitate, identify, or advise on public policy issues crucial to Internet governance, focusing on cross-cutting issues not adequately addressed by existing mechanisms.
2. **Concerns About Effectiveness:**
    
    - Critics worry about the IGF becoming a "talk shop" with limited practical impact, emphasizing the need to prevent it from producing meaningless outcomes rather than addressing substantial issues.
3. **Controversy Over Tangible Outcomes:**
    
    - From its inception, debates have centered around the IGF's ability to produce tangible outcomes that meaningfully impact internet governance, reflecting skepticism about the efficacy of multi-stakeholder dialogues.
4. **Initial Focus and Formal Outcomes:**
    
    - Initially, the IGF concentrated on fostering discourse, collaboration, and networking, with the chairman’s report being the primary formal output—a summary of discussions without consensus on specific recommendations.

**Slide 2: Evolving Practices and the Future of IGF**

1. **UN Working Group Recommendations:**
    
    - A UN working group recommended that the IGF develop more tangible outcomes to increase its political relevance, suggesting a focus on specific policy questions and documenting diverse opinions.
2. **Exploring New Documentation Methods:**
    
    - In response, the IGF has explored new methods to document its activities and produce more formal outcomes, such as the Best Practice Forum on Internet exchange points, which created guidelines for setting up local exchange points.
3. **Debates on Process vs. Outcome:**
    
    - While some view the IGF's dialogue-centric approach as a strength, fostering the convergence of expertise and norms, others critique it for lack of substantial outcomes and the potential marginalization of important issues.
4. **Impact and Perception of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue:**
    
    - The effectiveness of the IGF's policy dialogue remains uncertain, with no empirical studies to assess its impact. This perpetuates debates on whether multi-stakeholderism merely serves as a procedural value or can effectively address significant public interest objectives.
5. **Challenges in Defining and Achieving Outcomes:**
    
    - Stakeholders have not reached consensus on what constitutes meaningful outcomes or the types of outcomes the IGF should strive for, highlighting the challenges and limitations of multi-stakeholder input in producing actionable results.
