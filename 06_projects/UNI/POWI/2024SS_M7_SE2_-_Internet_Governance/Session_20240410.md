>Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.

>  For some hippies, this vision could only berealised by rejecting scientific progress as a false Godandreturning to nature. Others, in contrast, believed that technological progress would inevitably turn their libertarian principles into social fact.
>  Crucially, influenced by the theories of Marshall McLuhan, these technophiliacs thought that theconvergence of media, computing and telecommunications would inevitably create the electronic agora—a virtual place where everyone would be able to express their opinions without fear of censorship. Despite being a middle-aged English professor, McLuhan preached the radical message that the power of big business andbiggovernment would be imminently overthrown bythe intrinsically empowering effects of new technology on individuals.

>The Californian Ideology offers a way of understanding thelived reality of these digital artisans.Ontheone hand, these core workers are a privileged part of the labour force. Ontheother hand, they are the heirs of the radical ideas of the community media activists. The Californian Ideology, therefore, simultaneously reflects the disciplines of market economics andthefreedoms of hippie artisanship.

>hypermedia is a key component of the next stage of capitalism.As Zuboff points out, the introduction of media, computing, and telecommunications technologies into the factory andthe office is the culmination of a long process of separation of the workforce from direct involvement in production (Zuboff, 1988).

>However, although they borrow McLuhan's technological determinism, Gingrich and the Tofflers aren't advocates of the electronic agora. Onthe contrary, they claim that the convergence of the media, computing, and telecommunications will producean electronic marketplace: 'Incyberspace..., market after market is being transformed bytechnological progress from a "natural monopoly" to onein which competition is the rule' (Progress and Freedom Foundation, 1994, p. 5).

>If its holy precepts are refuted by profane history, why have the myths of the 'free market' so influenced the proponents of the Californian Ideology? Living within a contract culture, the hi-tech artisans lead a schizophrenic existence. On the one hand, they cannot challenge the primacy of the marketplace over their lives. On the other hand, they resent attempts by those in authority to encroach on their individual autonomy. By mixing NewLeft and New Right, the Californian Ideology provides a mystical resolution of the contradictory attitudes held by members of the 'virtual class'.

Not sure if I can agree:

>The triumph of this retro-futurism is a result of the failure of renewal in the U.S.A. during the late '60s and early '70s. Following the confrontation atPeople's Park, the struggle between the American establishment and the counterculture entered into a spiral of violent confrontation. While theVietnamese—at thecost of enormous human suffering—were able toexpel the American invaders from their country, the hippies and their allies in the black civil rights movement were eventually crushed by a combination of state repression andcultural co-option.

>The Californian Ideology perfectly encapsulates the consequences of this defeat formembers of the 'virtual class'. Although they enjoy cultural freedom won by thehippies, most of them are no longer actively involved in the struggle to build 'ecotopia'. Instead ofopenly rebelling against the system, these digital artisans now accept that individual freedom can only be achieved by working within the constraints of technological progress and the 'free market'. In many cyberpunk novels, this asocial libertarianism is personified by thecentral character of the hacker, who is a lone individual fighting for survival within the virtual world of information (Gibson, 1984,1986,1989; Sterling, 1988)

>Across the world, the Californian Ideology has been embraced as an optimistic andemancipatory form of technological determinism. Yet, this Utopian fantasy of the West Coast depends upon its blindness toward—and dependence on—the social andracialpolarisation of the society from which it was born. Despite itsradical rhetoric, the Californian Ideology is ultimately pessimistic about fundamental social change. Unlike the hippies, its advocates are not struggling to build 'ecotopia' or even to help revive the New Deal.
