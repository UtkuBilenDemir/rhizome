## Ch 4

> [!quote]+ 51 - 53
> The best network is not only simple, low-cost, robust, and innovation-friendly, it is also best at promoting a free, democratic, pluralistic, participatory society; a society in which people with new business ideas are free to fail and free to succeed in the marketplace.’2
> [...]
> Internet governance bodies are reflexively open. The IETF is highly participatory and transparent. Participation is not restricted by credentials, and its documentation and records are open and freely available, allowing oversight and accountability.
> [...]
> Access to decision-making •Transparent procedures • Published pro-competition goals • Published objective criteria for technology selection •No overstandardization • Access to the standard.

> [!quote]- UNIX - FSF
> It was a proprietary system, designed for use within AT&T, although it was so handy that it was often licensed to other organizations, which led to the UNIX philosophy spreading. The lack of openness led to frustrations, as engineers found themselves having to pay for licences in order to code on the system. Unhappy with this, Richard Stallman and colleagues formed the Free Software Foundation, and began to develop a UNIX variant, GNU (standing for ‘GNU’s Not UNIX’), under a new type of open licence.

> [!quote]- LINUX
> In 1991 in Helsinki, Linus Torvalds released the source code for his own OS based on earlier work on GNU, allowing a community of programmers to develop the system, called Linux, further. It became one of the earliest important pieces of open source software, recognizably UNIX-like, with its advantages, but built by a relatively decentralized cooperative community.

## Ch 7

> [!quote] 78 Freedom
> In R.H. Tawney’s words, quoted by Berlin, ‘freedom for the pike is death to the minnows’.3 In particular, the Internet amplifies interference in its users’ negative liberty in two ways. First of all, it provides connectivity within the telecommunications network, so that online activity is directly connected to other people’s online space. Secondly, many formerly real-world interactions and activities have migrated online, so that activity on the Internet now intrudes directly into the offline world.

> [!error]- 79 Bourgeouis 
> Habermas chronicled the original impetus towards a public sphere in the growing (in numbers, wealth, and political influence) bourgeois society of the eighteenth century. The bourgeoisie has had a bad press over the years, from aristocrats, academics, Marxists, and snobs (many people are, regrettably, all four).6 Sociologically, the concept has been defined thus: 
> 	City dweller practising an honored profession or owning a business or functioning at a managerial level in someone else’s enterprise, including governmental and non-profit enterprises.7 
> Morally, we can circumscribe the ethical world of such a person. 
> 	Such a person faces a particular set of ethical problems. He has the anxious ethical task of learning how to be a counselor yet self-prudent, a salesman yet otherloving, a boss yet just, a bureaucrat yet courageous, a scientist yet faithful.8

> [!question]- 80 Bro, don't choke on that
> The bourgeois world is ordered, respectful, polite, decent, well-behaved, wellmannered, and considerate, and because of this foundation, liberty within it is meaningful and valuable, a positive liberty. The second vision we will discuss in this book wishes to project this foundation onto the Internet. We can characterize the bourgeois vision as the conjunction of two principles: • 
> - The preservation of human rights and human dignity • 
> - A precautionary ideal of anticipating harms and neutralizing them in advance.

> ep in. There is a debate over whether the United States, where privacy protection is based on different principles, reaches EU standards.32 The US approach is sectoral—i.e. the extent of protection depends on what kind of information we are talking about. Financial or health information receives more protection than, say, commercial information, whereas in the European Union, personal data of any kind has the same coverage, whether it refers to the data subject’s health or hobbies. The US approach suggests that certain types of information have the proven potential to cause more harms, and they therefore get more legal protection consistent with its common law system, where privacy is treated as a tort.

### Ch 9 The DC Commercial Internet

> [!quote]- Definition
> This model has driven extraordinary innovation online, and has created high-value network effects, with a strong correlation between rates of patenting of Web technology and levels of the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite stock index.1 Privacy may be a good, but most people appear to be willing to trade it away, and so, on this vision, why should they be prevented from so doing?

> [!quote]- 104> Contents
> Markets have externalities, effects on parties external to a transaction that are not covered by the exchange or the economic activity. Much of the literature focuses on negative externalities, the costs imposed on a community by activities that are not borne by the participants. Common examples include environmental pollution caused by an industrial process that is not paid for by either producer or consumer, but rather by wider society, of which carbon emissions are perhaps the most pressing current example. Many exchanges also provide positive externalities, where wider society benefits—for instance, the existence of a factory in a town may result in positive spillover effects on other businesses which benefit from the wages paid to the workers. It has been argued that positive externalities—in particular, the innovations that capitalism has produced, whose benefits cannot be restricted to the direct parties to transactions—are responsible for many of the social and economic advances of Western societies since the eighteenth century

> [!quote] 106 Comparison
> The associated economy tends to be a liberal market economy, characterized by exchange of goods and services in a context of competition, contract, and price signals.7 The contrasts to the somewhat more controlling characteristics of civil law and coordinated market economies as exemplified in the Brussels Bourgeois Internet.

> [!quote] 107
> It has been argued that open standards protect fundamental rights more effectively than proprietary ones, and so technologies such as Linux, Android, and Firefox are ‘better’ than their protected competitors.14 But the relation between commercial property interests and consumer rights is particularly contested in the United States, where corporations have a more substantial legal personality than elsewhere, thanks to the common law inheritance.15 Hence the consumer (and other) rights of individuals face a stronger challenge from corporate private property rights than in other jurisdictions.16 For example, the use of cookies to pass information between servers and clients raised privacy concerns almost immediately after their invention, and in 1996 the FTC was suggesting that control of cookies should default to users.

> [!quote] 109
> Net neutrality is not a binary. Pure Silicon Valley (no discrimination, absolutely neutral between packets) and pure DC (no regulation, any discrimination allowed, fee charging allowed, including the exclusion of content providers from the network) are endpoints on a scale. In the middle, one could imagine combinations of congestion charging with ‘common carriage’, i.e. the service provider guarantees to carry whatever it is asked to carry (rather like a national postal service, as opposed to a courier which can be selective about what it takes on). This might allow discrimination to improve quality of service, but not on the basis of price (so the network might speed up VOIP or video, but would not charge those content providers more, or offer discounts to those on slower speeds).

> [!quote] Open Source
> Hence supporters of the DC Commercial Internet typically do benefit from openness, and so will often join in coalition with more unconditional defenders of openness against more broadly commercial interests. One such flashpoint has been on intellectual property and digital rights management (DRM). The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) of 2012 was introduced to give US law enforcement agencies greater powers to address a bag of issues, including the online sale of counterfeit goods, especially drugs, and copyright infringement; powers included the ability to target websites deemed to be infringing these rules by preventing search engines from linking to them and financial service companies from handling their payments.
