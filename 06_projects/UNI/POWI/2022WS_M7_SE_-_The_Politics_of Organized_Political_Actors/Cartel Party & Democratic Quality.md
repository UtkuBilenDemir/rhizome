created: 2023-05-01 02:50

Yes, several publications have connected the cartel party concept to concerns about insufficient democratic quality. These works explore the implications of cartelization for democratic processes, representation, accountability, and responsiveness. Some examples include:

1.  Blyth, M., & Katz, R. S. (2005). From Catch-all Politics to Cartelisation: The Political Economy of the Cartel Party. West European Politics, 28(1), 33-60. This article connects the cartel party concept to broader political economy trends, arguing that the cartelization of political parties is a consequence of political and economic changes in advanced industrial democracies. The authors discuss how cartel parties contribute to a decline in democratic quality by undermining competition, responsiveness, and representation.

2.  Koß, M. (2010). The Legitimacy of Party Funding: Explaining the Change from Membership Fees to State Subsidies in Western Europe. West European Politics, 33(6), 1147-1168. Koß's article focuses on the implications of state subsidies for party funding and the cartelization of political parties. The author argues that the shift from membership fees to state subsidies undermines the legitimacy of party funding, which in turn can lead to a decline in the quality of democracy.

3.  Poguntke, T., & Webb, P. (2005). The Presidentialization of Politics in Democratic Societies: A Framework for Analysis. In T. Poguntke & P. Webb (Eds.), The Presidentialization of Politics: A Comparative Study of Modern Democracies (pp. 1-25). Oxford: Oxford University Press. This book chapter discusses the implications of the cartel party concept for the presidentialization of politics, arguing that the transformation of political parties has contributed to a shift in political power away from parties and toward individual political leaders. The authors suggest that this trend has negative implications for democratic quality, as it undermines the representative function of political parties.
