- why do we study parties, interest groups; and why study them together?

We are interested in the operation of power. 
Their influence isn public decision making should be analysed together.
Triangle of voters, parties 

## Political Parties

- inside-outside formal political institutions
	- as an idea with us since the kickoff of the modern political theory with machiavelli 
	- exist since the antiquity
- The modern concept is related to the factions in the British Parlament
	- faction had a negative meaning to it
- Since the end of the 18. century; political organisation outside of the national assemblies
- One of the transforming inventions of the 19. Century -> parliamentary government and universal suffrage
- Unlikely to fit one single model to all:
	- UK, US; early development of the parties
	- Germany, France late development

## Interest Groups
- Long historical roots
- 4 Phases:
	- Preindustrial 1830-1870: charitable orgs
	- 1860-1900: trade unions, employer orgs
	- 1920-1950: professional associations, promotional groups
	- Post-industrial era: environmental groups...
- After mass suffrage: clear division of labour
- the domain of the organised political parties became the **elections**
- Interest groups remained related, some co-operated with the parties
- Played central roles in the democ. politics

## Parties, Interest Groups and Democracy

- Still disputed relationship
- Does party organisation or party competition matter most; in what way?
- **Would the elites get detached if the inner party structure is too democratic?** (Schattenschneider & Downs vs. Duverger)
- Strong vs. weak parties and the importance of interest groups; majoritarian view vs. pluralism 
- Pluralism on Igs
- Yet **responsible party government model** gained ground

## Party Concepts/Definitions

## The Concept of the Interest Groups
- **Interest** is kind of a tricky term
- Interest group/ interest group/ pressure group/ NGOs etc.
- Main distinction (contemporary):
	- behavioural: focus on policy related activities
	- Organisational: mobilisation/ voluntary focus membership based organisations

> **Ideology | Structure | Behaviour**

## Different party goals, and models

- Vote seeking
- Office-seeking
- Policy-seeking

- **Historical institutionalism**

- **Normative Institutionalism**
REflect the structure you are striving for!

**NO ESSENTIALISM**
