## Concepts and Theoretical  Approaches in the Study  of Political Parties

- What is the main difference between a sociological/structural and rational choice approach to political parties as organizations?  
- What type of theoretical approach does  Katz and Mair’s article mirror? Justify your conclusion.  
- What type of analytical tool do the “party models” presented in Katz and Mair’s article represent?

Contrary to the discrete classification of the parties through their relationship with society, Katz and Mair introduce a dialectical approach that focuses on the analysis of the party conjecture over time. The dialectical process is not only enabling the observation of the network of the parties by taking their actions and reactions to each other in an evolutionary process into the equation but also emphasises that each of the defined party categories is simply relevant to a specific stage/period, to specific conditions/status-quo in an ever continuing process (see Katz and Mair 1995, 5-6).

In their dialectical analysis cadre type old party structure getting its power from the quality/elite members who are very well integrated into state functions enables the birth of the mass party characterised by its large membership base and its role as a mediator of *volonte generale* between the society and the state. This archetype is countered over time by the birth of less membership focused *catch-all parties* which try to gain the most votes by introducing short-term strategic policy goals instead of sticking with monolithic ideologies and by playing more of a broker role between the state and society. Catch-all parties symbolised the relative convergence of the traditional left and traditional right parties as they strive for a larger voter base through strategic policy programmes causing a policy consensus. Finally, the cartel party model with its strong technocratic core emerged as a more flexible/professionalised party structure utilising the political network/actors better in order to not just obtain, but also to maintain political power more effectively. In this sense, the definition of the cartel party shows some similarities to the party transformation envisioned in the post-democracy related theories whereas professional management of the political arena becomes the main goal of the parties while the representation is losing its relevance. Also including Katz and Mair's further mention of the challenges to the cartel parties, the methodological approach they introduced emphasises the analysis of the party characteristics in *context*. As in the analysis of a natural phenomenon, a specific social event, or even a mathematical function; the conditions of the environment, the building blocks of the phenomena, and the observation of the past are necessary in order to understand the phenomena, but also to approximate its future. However, Dalton et al. (2011/2013) disagree especially with the cartel party formulation of Katz and Mair and introduce an analysis of the party-state relationships instead of specific categories of parties. 

In the rational choice-based approach against structural analysis approach (Strøm 1990), political parties are formulated as personified organisations which much like the rational person *homo economicus*, act on their self-interest to build more influence, and power as well as maximise and maintain their position. In that sense the inner behaviour of the parties in seeking political power like how they form alliances, how they form their inner party structures, how they choose their candidates, how they decide and formalise their communication with media, how they produce their policy programmes play a more important role in the analysis than the outer/historical/dialectical factors in the structural analysis.

## Parties and Interest Groups: Interests,  Ideology and Policy Positions

- How would you define (party) “ideology” and how would you define “policy”?  
- How can we categorize interest groups according to the type of substantive interest they represent?  
- What is an ideological “party family”? Is this a useful analytical tool if we want to compare the policy profile of interest groups and parties?

The political factions which are often seen as the predecessors of the political parties were groups founded by specific ideological alignments. Political parties are, therefore, formed by groups bound by an ideological alignment (see Vassalo and Wilcox 2006, 413). Ideology can be seen as a characterisation of a belief system that defines a party's identity (see the definition of Mair and Mudde 1998, 220), that acts as a source code specifying the frame of the organisation's actions, its *modus operandi*. However, as Downs (1957) states ideology is often seen as simply devices parties use to obtain votes, and control the government. Yet, even when the ideology is merely used as a tool selected by the professional party members or consultants to adopt, and abandon, it still indicates a party's agenda/ possible actions in a specific period.

The building blocks of the party ideology, however, are founded in the differences/ lines of division in a societal structure that emerge over time which Lipset and Rokkan (1967) define as *cleavages*. Although the position of the parties on specific cleavages defines the party's ideological position, the ideological formation of the party can also define its position on specific cleavages. Yet, there can be different positions in a party on a specific cleavage; similarly, some of the cleavages stay unrepresented in the party structure possibly causing a future party to adopt a position to gain (more) support. 

Similarities in ideological backgrounds cause some parties to act in an alliance to some extent. Although the classifications of those alliances or the similarities in decisions and behaviour are often disputed, those groups are often referred to as *party families*. The analytical benefit of the party family typology is the possibility of a country/region/electoral system-agnostic categorisation of the political parties.

Categorisation of the interest groups has been done by different approaches, there is no common approach. Baroni et al. follow an empirical approach with a large-N sample group by comparing different classification schemes and focusing on specific background characteristics including
- membership structure,
- level of mobilisation,
- number of staff,
- and financial resources.
Through their substantial interest, the groups can be classified under ideological groups, economic groups, professional groups, public-Interest groups, and associational groups.

## Decision-Making and Public Policy: (When) Do Political Parties and Interest Groups Matter
- How can we measure parties’ general influence on public policy?  
- What is meant by “interest group influence” over public policy and how can we go about to measure it?  
- What seem to mainly explain the lobby success of interest group?

The relationship between the control of the government and the policy outputs is complex and multi-faceted. The possible conflict between the interests of actors like interest groups, and the voters as well as the nature of past policies, and bureaucratic processes are just some of those (see Dalton et al. 2011, 194). Although in theory parties are expected to follow a programmatic frame before taking office and implement policies accordingly thereafter, parties often get stuck in structural constraints which put parties' autonomy in shaping the government into question. In alliance with the rational choice theory, one of the common approaches to understanding the relationship is to consider parties as unified actors seeking the implementation of their own policy preferences by voting in the legislative process whereas the autonomy of the individual party members is limited. However, on the other side, the "policy matters" thesis claims that parties are playing a more active role in founding, shaping, presenting, and implementing policies. This alternative perspective claims parties are the main actors in mobilising the masses and they are flexible enough to pursue fitting coalitions to those self-made policy frameworks. Testing of those two relatively conflicting hypotheses is suffering from the conflicting results between varying qualitative, and quantitative methods, as well as, different data sets. Finally, ideological differences play a significant role in the direction of policy-making; as Dalton et al. emphasise the ideologically left-leaning parties usually spend consistently more on social programs while holding office in comparison with the right-leaning parties, which reinforces the argument that the parties indeed shape policies through their protocol/ideology.

Similarly, Finseraas and Vernby (2011) explore the role of partisanship in the welfare state in the so-called "era of austerity". The quantitative analysis of the political polarisation between the *left bloc* and *right bloc*. While the results indicate that polarised party ideology secures more votes, they also reinforce the policy matters argument by showing the ideological promises of the parties matter (although after a specific threshold of polarization, especially if the welfare state is under threat).

According to Klüver (2011), the influence of interest groups in policymaking is also a complex issue. Despite the methodological difficulties, qualitative methods and quantitative text analysis measuring the lobbying success show that the office-holding politicians are contacted by a multitude of interest groups with either differentiating or conflicting interests, and the lobbying success is usually dependent on the strength of the coalition a specific interest group is in. Klüver also emphasises that there are structural/process-relevant elements that could make the interest group influence measurable like the nature and the accessibility of the policy-making process, the context of the specific policy (salience, complexity, etc.), and the characteristics of the policymaking arena like the level of polarization, power relations, etc.

## The Legislative and Governmental Arena: The Strategies and Role of Partie

- What is a “legislative party” and why is this an important organizational unit in Parliament?  

- How can parties be a remedy against so-called “agency loss” in the chain of delegation in parliamentary democracies?

A legislative party is an organised group of already elected members of a representative body without the necessity of sharing the same political party that acts as a party in government. Its functional purpose is especially relevant policymaking process since they are forming a united front for specific policy issues, they might also play a role in strengthening the policy influence of specific parties. Their strongly hierarchical structure and often lacking transparency, however, make it hard to see the inner network and operation. Although empirical knowledge about the legislative party mechanism is still not that rich, and they seem to stay as a black box, they are raising the question if their decision-making processes are a threat to the representation of voters' interests in the legislative processes.

Along the same lines, Müller (2003) focuses on delegation and accountability. Especially in Western European democracies, the parties play a central role in the constitutional chain to ensure the chain of delegation and accountability. Towards that goal, they apply a range of ex-ante and ex-post mechanisms to prevent/contain agency loss (ibid. 330). However, there are major differences between different delegation chains and the role of the party weakens as we go further down the chain.

## Party Organizations and Organized Interests in Civil Society: Structure, Members and Leader

- Does it make sense to study parties and interest groups together, as “political organizations”? Why? Why not?  

Political Parties and interest groups are in a continuous relationship in the political arena, both the decision-making/execution and agenda-formation processes are influenced by the exchanges between those organisations. According to Fraussen and Halpin, they share often lots of structural and ideological similarities. Studying those organisations together could help empirical work map the political surface more comprehensively. However, they also note that both political parties and interest groups should adapt to the changing political environment by e.g. getting more transparent and addressing societal movements. 

- Is the mass party model still relevant when describing key organizational features of contemporary political parties?  

Kölln (2016) emphasises the declining party membership in Europe. Since mass parties are associated with high numbers of members, this statement speaks against the contemporary relevance of mass parties. Poguntke et al. (2016) also reinforce Kölln's argument by stating a widespread decline in party membership.  However, according to Poguntke et al., the significant differences between the parties among different countries depend on various parameters, and the concept of the mass party still contains some relevance. 

- How is state funding often argued to affect the role (position) of members (vis-à-vis leaders) in political organizations

Bolleyer and Correa (2022) emphasise the importance of access to resources when it comes to influence and participation in civil society organisations. In this sense, the distribution of state funding plays a critical role by setting the dependency of the organisations on the members. In the case of the dependency on outer resources, there is always a risk of a decline in member influence and participation.
