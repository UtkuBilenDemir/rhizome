Crittique of the group approach

- Pluralism -> 1950 (the peak)
- No real theory, a perspective?
- Critique of the descriptive accuracy
- MacFarland 2010: 

## Three theory steps
- Group theory befeor 1960s
- Dahl's Pluralism?
- Multiple elitism (Schattschneider)/ interest groups liberalism (e.g. Lowi) -> Critique of the pluralism, as it favours the actors with more access to resources 

## Other challenges
- How to measure power and influence? *And how do we prevent or balance those exactly?*
- Empirical findings showed limited impact by groups on governmental decision-making .

**result:** decreased interest for interest groups altogether or shift to analysis of mobilisation: who can mobilise for what cause and how much.

## Interest gorups and collective action
- Mancur Olson is critical here
- How do groups mobilise 

- offering extra, selective incentives to participate in the collective

-> Allowed deduction and scientific analysis (Olson's theory)

### Neo-pluralism
- Further theo. extentions to the Olsonian Model, social norms, structures, external patrons
- 80s, 90s the rise of 'neo-pluralism'
	- Highlighting existence of hundersds of policy issue
	- C

- Honjaki et al. 2012 -> Builds on Baumgartner & Leech (also Beyers et al. 2009)
	- Literature on mobilisation: cumulative
	- A revival of studies of the external strategies
	- Literature on lobbying and influence: disjointed (theory pluralism)
	- Too much empirical approach without much theory
	- Influence of rational choice, social movement theory, and issue network theory
	- Need more content, and more critique

# Political Parties as Organisations
- The party at latge vs. faces of parties
- **party change**: wholesale transformations; vs. discrete limited changes

## Structural/ System-level Trends

- Elite/Cadre Party (19. Century)
- Mass party (1880s-1960s)
- Catch all party (1945)
- Cartel party (1970-)
