# Cartel Party & Democratic Fatigue
created: 2023-05-01 04:46

Could you explicitly focus on the rise of the populist parties in this context and argue how cartel parties create a democratic fatigue allowing increased support to the populist parties?

The rise of populist parties in recent years can be partially attributed to the democratic fatigue caused by cartel parties. Cartel parties, which are characterized by their close cooperation with one another and their focus on maintaining power, may contribute to a sense of disillusionment among voters. This disillusionment can create an opening for populist parties to gain support by presenting themselves as a radical alternative to the established political order.

1.  Mudde, C., & Kaltwasser, C. R. (2017). Populism: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press. Mudde and Kaltwasser argue that the rise of populism can be understood as a response to the perceived failures of the mainstream political establishment, including cartel parties. They suggest that populist parties can exploit public dissatisfaction with the political status quo, often by framing themselves as champions of the 'ordinary people' against a corrupt and self-serving political elite (p. 23-24).
    
2.  Berman, S. (2017). The Pipe Dream of Undemocratic Liberalism. Journal of Democracy, 28(3), 29-38. Berman discusses how the perception of cartel parties as unresponsive to citizens' needs can fuel support for populist parties. She argues that the lack of meaningful political competition and the convergence of mainstream parties can create a sense of democratic fatigue among voters, which populist parties can capitalize on by offering a more radical and seemingly responsive alternative (p. 33).
    
3.  Inglehart, R., & Norris, P. (2016). Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash. HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series RWP16-026. Inglehart and Norris explore the factors driving support for populist parties, including the role of cartel parties in creating democratic fatigue. They suggest that the perceived unresponsiveness of mainstream parties, including cartel parties, has led to increased support for populist alternatives that promise to upend the political status quo and return power to the people (p. 29-30).
    
4.  Mounk, Y. (2018). The People vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It. Harvard University Press. Mounk argues that the decline of political competition and the cartelization of political parties have contributed to a growing sense of democratic disenchantment among voters. This disenchantment, in turn, has fueled the rise of populist parties that promise to break with the established political order and restore democracy to the people (p. 119-120).
    

In summary, the cartelization of political parties and the perception that they are unresponsive to citizens' needs can contribute to democratic fatigue, providing an opportunity for populist parties to gain support by positioning themselves as a more radical and responsive alternative to the established political order.
