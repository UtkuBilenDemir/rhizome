How does cartel party concept align r differ than Colin Crouch's post-democracy theory? Could you please compare with citations?

The cartel party concept, as introduced by Katz and Mair, and Colin Crouch's post-democracy theory both address concerns about the health of democracy and the changing role of political parties in contemporary democratic systems. However, they focus on different aspects of these transformations.



These two theories can be seen as complementary, as they both capture different aspects of the challenges facing contemporary democracies. The cartel party concept helps to understand how political parties may contribute to a decline in democratic quality, while post-democracy theory provides a broader framework for analyzing the overall shift in political power and decision-making.

In summary, both the cartel party concept and post-democracy theory raise important questions about the state of democracy and the role of political parties in contemporary democratic systems. By examining these theories together, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex challenges facing democracies today.
