# Dalton on Cartel Party
created: 2023-05-01 04:48
Dalton, Farrell, and McAllister (2011/2013) provide a different perspective on political parties and their role in democratic linkage in their book "Political Parties and Democratic Linkage: How Parties Organize Democracy." While they acknowledge the importance of Katz and Mair's cartel party thesis, they disagree on some points and emphasize a different approach to understanding party-state relationships.

1.  Party-voter linkage: Dalton et al. (2011/2013) emphasize the importance of understanding the linkage between parties and voters, which is not the main focus of Katz and Mair's (1995) cartel party thesis. They argue that the quality of democratic linkage depends on parties' capacity to represent citizens' preferences, policy positions, and issues (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 4-6).
    
2.  Role of institutions: Dalton et al. (2011/2013) stress the role of political institutions in shaping party behavior and party systems. They argue that institutional factors, such as electoral systems, party finance regulations, and party membership rules, influence parties' strategies and their relationships with voters (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 24-27).
    
3.  Party change and adaptation: Dalton et al. (2011/2013) point out that parties are adaptive organizations that respond to changing political and social contexts. They argue that some of the cartel party features identified by Katz and Mair (1995) might be better understood as adaptive strategies of parties rather than signs of a new party type (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 27-28).
    
4.  Party performance: While Katz and Mair (1995) focus on the internal organization and structure of parties, Dalton et al. (2011/2013) emphasize party performance as a critical aspect of democratic linkage. They argue that parties' capacity to deliver on their promises and address citizens' concerns is essential for the quality of democracy (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 29-30).
    
5.  Different approach to party typology: Dalton et al. (2011/2013) propose an alternative party typology based on the relationship between parties and civil society, ranging from strong to weak. They argue that this typology is more relevant for understanding party change and the dynamics of party systems than the cartel party model proposed by Katz and Mair (1995) (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 33-34).
    

In conclusion, Dalton et al. (2011/2013) provide an alternative perspective on the study of political parties and their role in democratic linkage. While they recognize the importance of Katz and Mair's (1995) cartel party thesis, they emphasize different aspects of party dynamics and propose a different approach to understanding party-state relationships.
