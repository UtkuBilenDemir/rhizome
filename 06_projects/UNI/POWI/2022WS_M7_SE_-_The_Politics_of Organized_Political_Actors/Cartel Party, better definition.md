As a political scientist, it is crucial to analyze political parties from a dialectical perspective, as Katz and Mair (1995) suggest. This approach allows for the examination of the evolution of parties over time, taking into account their actions and reactions in response to changing political and social conditions (Katz and Mair 1995, p. 5-6).

In their dialectical analysis, Katz and Mair (1995) trace the development of party types from the cadre party, which derives its power from elite members with strong connections to state functions, to the mass party, characterized by its large membership base and its role as a mediator of the _volonté générale_ between society and the state. The mass party is eventually superseded by the catch-all party, which seeks to maximize votes by adopting short-term strategic policy goals and playing a broker role between state and society, rather than adhering to monolithic ideologies (Katz and Mair 1995, p. 8-10). This transformation leads to a convergence of the traditional left and right parties as they pursue broader voter bases through strategic policy programs, resulting in a policy consensus.

The most recent party model identified by Katz and Mair (1995) is the cartel party, characterized by its technocratic core and focus on utilizing political networks and actors to maintain political power effectively. 

The cartel party model bears some resemblance to the party transformation described in post-democracy theories, as professional management of the political arena becomes the main goal of parties, while representation loses its relevance (Katz and Mair 1995, p. 14-15; Crouch 2004, p. 7-9). Nevertheless, Katz and Mair (2009) also acknowledge the challenges that cartel parties face, emphasizing the importance of analyzing party characteristics in context.

While Katz and Mair's dialectical approach provides valuable insights into the evolution of political parties, some scholars like Dalton et al. (2011/2013) disagree with their cartel party formulation. Instead, they propose an analysis of party-state relationships that moves beyond specific party categories (Dalton et al. 2011/2013, pp. 25-27). This perspective offers an alternative way of understanding party dynamics and their connection to the broader political system.

In conclusion, Katz and Mair's dialectical approach offers a useful framework for understanding the development of political parties over time, highlighting the importance of context and the interplay between parties, society, and the state. However, alternative perspectives such as that of Dalton et al. (2011/2013) also contribute to the ongoing debate on party transformations and their implications for democracy.

## some highlights

'll provide a more detailed summary of Katz and Mair's publications, including some of my own comments.

Katz, R. S., & Mair, P. (1995). Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: The Emergence of the Cartel Party. Party Politics, 1(1), 5-28.

1.  The article begins by discussing the existing models of party organization: the cadre party, the mass party, and the catch-all party. Each model represents a specific historical stage of party development and emphasizes different aspects of party organization and goals (pp. 6-8).
    
2.  Katz and Mair propose the cartel party model as a new ideal type representing contemporary political parties. The cartel party is characterized by its reliance on state resources, collusion with other parties, and detachment from the electorate (pp. 15-16). This model reflects the authors' observation of the changing nature of political parties and their increasing focus on securing resources from the state and maintaining their positions within the political system.
    
3.  The article emphasizes that the cartel party model is not a precise description of any specific party, but rather an ideal type that captures the general trends observed across contemporary political parties (p. 6). This is an important point to keep in mind when analyzing the concept and its applicability to real-world cases.
    
4.  Katz and Mair identify several factors that have contributed to the emergence of the cartel party model, including the decline of traditional social cleavages, the increasing importance of state resources for party survival, and the professionalization of politics (pp. 17-19). These factors have driven parties to adapt their organizational structures and strategies to secure their positions in the political system.
    
5.  The authors discuss the potential implications of cartel party development for democracy, including reduced political competition, increased distance between parties and the public, and diminished capacity for representation (pp. 25-27). These concerns highlight the potential negative consequences of the cartel party model for the quality of democratic governance.

Katz, R. S., & Mair, P. (2009). The Cartel Party Thesis: A Restatement. Perspectives on Politics, 7(4), 753-766.

1.  The 2009 article aims to clarify the cartel party concept and address misunderstandings and criticisms that emerged following the initial 1995 publication. Katz and Mair emphasize that the concept should be understood as an ideal type, not a precise description of any specific party (p. 753).
    
2.  Katz and Mair revisit the key characteristics of the cartel party model, including its reliance on state resources, collusion with other parties, and detachment from the electorate. They argue that these features have become even more pronounced since the original publication, further validating the relevance of the model (pp. 754-757).
    
3.  The authors address several criticisms, such as the claim that the cartel party model is too deterministic or that it ignores the role of ideology in shaping party behavior. They clarify that the model does not assume that all parties are becoming cartel parties or that the model applies universally (p. 758).
    
4.  Katz and Mair also discuss the implications of cartel party development for democratic quality, reiterating concerns about reduced competition, diminished representation, and potential threats to accountability and responsiveness (pp. 761-762). This discussion highlights the ongoing relevance of the cartel party concept for understanding contemporary challenges to democracy.

In conclusion, Katz and Mair's publications on the cartel party concept provide a valuable framework for understanding the changing nature of political parties and their implications for democratic governance. By emphasizing the role of state resources, collusion, and detachment from the electorate, the cartel party model offers a useful lens through which to analyze contemporary party behavior and its potential consequences for democratic quality
