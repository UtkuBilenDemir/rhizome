~\chapter{NOTES}

    
\newthought{Cartel Party characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, the moderation of class and other subcultural conflicts, and the increasing homogeneity of experiences and expectations of the vast majority of citizens associated with the rise of mass society and the welfare state
    \item Second, with the increasing reliance on mass media as the most effective mode of campaigning, and with the attendant increase in the need for professional expertise (pollsters, advertising consultants, direct-mail fund raisers and marketers), the economic costs of remaining competitive were rising more rapidly than the ability or willingness to pay of the party on the ground.
    \item Third, if one accepts the idea that there is a real limit beyond which the provision of public goods cannot be expanded without creating a fiscal crisis, then the governments of many welfare states appeared to have backed themselves into a corner from which the only escape without, and potentially even with, untenable tax increases was equally untenable service cuts.
    \item Although of a different type, one additional development can be added to this list. As politics has become an increasingly specialized profession, the potential personal costs of electoral defeat or organizational contraction have increased. \parencite[758]{katz2009}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
    while a cartel does imply constrained competition, this refers to the nature of the competition rather than to an absence of electoral turnover—to the question of whether it makes any difference who wins, not to the frequency with which different parties win. \parencite[757]{katz2009}

\chapter{UTKU}


Another central tendency of the political parties emphasised in the analysis of Katz and Mair is that \textbf{parties are moving towards the state.} \parencite[see 756]{katz2009}.

Another important tendency: \textbf{in those long-established democracies for which we gathered data,24 the weight of power within the party, as measured by changes in the locus of decision-making, as well as by the distribution of internal resources—finance, staff, etc.—has moved much more firmly into the hands of the party in public office.} This binds itself with the following hypotheses: \parencite[see 756]{katz2009}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Our hypothesis was and is simply this: that as the party in public office gains ascendancy within the party as a whole, its particular interests will be treated as being the interests of the party writ large. Moreover, although it might seem at first sight that the interests of the PPO could be summarized simply to lie in winning, 
    \item in our view it made more sense to see those interests as lying equally in having the possible costs of losing reduced as much as possible. After all, always winning is unlikely. We also further hypothesized that this would be true for the PPOs in all (mainstream) parties. And this, in turn, would be likely to encourage a system of mutual cooperation, that should, under normal circumstances, lead to the emergence of a Nash equilibrium: an equilibrium or compromise from which no one participant will have an incentive to defect.}\parencite[see 756]{katz2009}

\end{itemize}

\newthought{SUMMARY FROM KATZ and MAIR}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Putting these two sets of findings and their related hypotheses together leads to the following conclusions. First, parties are increasingly part of the state, and increasingly removed from society, and this new situation encourages them, or even forces them, to cooperate with one another. They can write their own checks, but only if there is general agreement to do so. 
    \item Second, these parties increasingly resemble one another; in terms of their electorates, policies, goals, styles, there is less and less dividing them—their interests are now much more shared, and this also facilitates cooperation. A very important part of their shared interest is to contain the costs of losing, and in this sense to find an equilibrium that suits all of their own “private” interests. This also means cooperation, even if this cooperation need not be overt or conscious. That is, even if parties might be disinclined to rely heavily on overt deals with one another, their mutual awareness of shared interests, and their sense of all being in the same boat and relying on the same sorts of resources, means that we can conclude by hypothesizing collusion (or its functional equivalent) and cartel-like behavior.

\end{itemize}
