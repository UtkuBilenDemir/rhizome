Following Bono’s unsolicited claim of 'surrogate representation.' in behalf of many people in Africa, this type of representation [@saward2009], where someone advocates for a group without being formally elected or directly asked to do so, challenges traditional notions of political legitimacy and electoral mandates. It prompts us to reconsider the concept of representation beyond electoral democracy and underscores the potential for influential individuals to impact lives across geographic and cultural boundaries.

Discussing the role of non-elected actors, such as activists or experts, adds another layer to the understanding of representation. These actors often take on roles that elected officials cannot, by articulating specific, sometimes marginalised, interests more vigorously or by overreaching national boundaries to represent transnational communities. Their work challenges the conventional geographic and electoral boundaries of political representation, suggesting that the political influence can and does operate on multiple levels and across various platforms. This complex interplay between elected and non-elected representation underscores a critical aspect of modern democracy: while the structures of states and elections provide a framework for governance, they do not encapsulate the entirety of political representation. In fact, much of the political representation occurs outside formal electoral contexts, through advocacy, activism, and other forms of public engagement.

The reflection on these themes reveals a sophisticated structure of representation that exists beyond the electoral framework of the liberal democracy. It involves a continual process of claiming, contesting, and redefining the boundaries and content of what it means to represent and be represented. This process is not only about reflecting existing identities and interests but also about forming new ones, thereby continuously transforming the political landscape.

> [!question] 
> Although, there is definitely a need for more discussion about the legitimacy in nonelectoral representatives. Turning to Kuyper's [-@kuyper2016] notion of only non-electoral representatives should legitimate themselves also raises a question if only having an electoral process should be enough to claim legitimacy [@kuyper2016, 1]. Just having a process, enough to claim full legitimacy?
> Can non-elected representatives genuinely embody the interests of those they claim to represent without formal electoral mandates?

On the issue of legitimacy and accountability, Kuyper probes the foundational legitimacy of non-elected representatives. This inquiry is important in understanding how such actors justify their representative claims. Here, the quesiton that leads to Kuyper's methodology is: What mechanisms ensure these representatives act in the best interest of those they represent? How do we reconcile the lack of direct electoral accountability with the influence these representatives wield?

Discussing the challenges posed by globalisation, Kuyper acknowledges that global issues complicate traditional representation structures, demanding a reevaluation of governance models. This global perspective is increasingly relevant, yet it complicates the practical application of representation. Critical questions here include: How can representatives be effectively held accountable in a multi-layered global context? Can the existing structures of democracy adapt to such complex governance needs without sacrificing local autonomy?

Lastly, while Kuyper's distinction between the public place and empowered space offers some clarification of the objectives for legitimacy, they cause more confusion than they are solving. Considering the actors frokm both spaces, there is a lot of overlapping and blurry distinctions. In some parts, it feels like some of the actors from public space hold even more power than the others.

Severs et al. [-@severs2016] cast a critical light on the traditional frameworks of political representation, urging a reconsideration that embraces intersectionality as central, not peripheral, to our understanding of politics. Their analysis pushes the boundaries of how we typically conceive representation by asserting that it is not merely a passive reflection of societal structures, but a dynamic process actively shaping the contexts of power, privilege, and disadvantage. This is a provocative departure from seeing representation solely as a process of mirroring pre-existing societal divisions. Instead, they propose that representation itself is a form of social interaction that (re)constitutes these divisions, potentially reinforcing or challenging them.

The authors prompt us to ask critical questions about the nature of representation: Is political representation truly fulfilling its role if it only perpetuates existing power dynamics without challenging or transforming them? Can a deeper engagement with intersectionality provide a more nuanced understanding of how representation impacts marginalised groups, not just in mirroring their current status but in actively shaping their political and social realities?

Furthermore, Severs et al. suggest that our focus should not only be on who is being represented but how the processes of representation themselves contribute to ongoing social stratifications. This perspective raises another set of questions: How do representational acts in politics construct and reconstruct the identities and agency of those represented? In what ways do these acts of representation perpetuate or disrupt established systems of power or contribute to the equality.
