## Thomassen

**Presence and representation**
How to form a representation if the presence is not possible.  ==> Everything is performative?

u: throghout a materialist post-structuralism

### Thomassen's Questions

> The question of representation is thus central to the divide between autonomy and hegemony. Theorists of autonomy and hegemony disagree over the role and the nature of representation: first, is representation constitutive or not? Second, to what extent does representation silence and/or give voice? Another way to sum up the difference between the two is to say that what divides them is whether we can think of the emergence of a new political subject without representation – that is, is a new subject of the left necessarily a subject of representation?

## Hardt & Negri

> Whereas Rousseau was so lucid and severe when identifying private property as the source of all kinds of corruption and cause of human suffering, he stumbles when he confronts the public as a problem of the social contract. Given that private property creates inequality, as Rousseau says, how can we invent a political system in which everything belongs to everyone and to no one? The trap closes in on Jean-Jacques—and on all of us.The public is meant to answer that question: what belongs to everyone and to no one really belongs to the state. It was necessary to come up with something to dress up its grip on the common, and to convince us that it represents us.

> Robert Michels famously theorized “the iron law of oligarchy” whereby political parties, even those that claim and attempt to represent their constituents, end up inevitably being ruled by a small clique. [...] His primary aim is to dispel false claims: don’t be fooled by parties that claim to represent you; all parties are ruled by oligarchies, even the socialists. Indeed today, despite numerous attempted reforms, political parties and the coalitions that surround them still in substantial ways decide elections and other key questions of political life. [...] Consider, for instance, the otherwise puzzling equation that Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, makes between the responsiveness of a representative to a voter and to a contributor:“It is the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies.
> [[@hardt2017]], 30

> Constituent power can thus no longer be conceived in purely political terms and must be mixed with social behaviors and new technologies of subsistence, resistance, and transformation of life. The process of the construction of new institutions must be absorbed into this new materiality. 
> [[@hardt2017]], 41 -> Habermas

### Right WIng?

> Right-wing populist movements, particularly those in the dominant countries, pose a conundrum for analysis insofar as in the search for sovereignty they combine paradoxically antielitist politics with efforts to maintain social hierarchies. One way to disentangle this knot is to follow the line of property essential to right-wing populism, one that is entirely infused by racial identity.
> [[@hardt2017]], 51

>To say that populism is grounded in the love of identity (a horrible, destructive form of political love, in our view) is undoubtedly true, but behind identity lurks property. Sovereignty and racialized property are the stigmata that mark the body of right-wing populisms.
>ibid.

**RQ:** How is the representative institutionalisation (or the lack thereof) in Gezi Movement to be understood in the context of public deliberation?

Why Gezi Movement:

1. Relatively spontaneous formation
2. Pluralist participation
3. Defence of a *public thing*
4. Heavy involvement of riot police
5. No clear collective representation (unless the committee selected by the government)
6. Unrepresentative claims
7. Anti-representative claims
8. Non-partisan claim
9. Different forms of action
10. Collapsed movement
11. Arguably living *public things* launched during the protests
