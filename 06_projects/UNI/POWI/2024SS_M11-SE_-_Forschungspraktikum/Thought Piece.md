# Thought Piece

It is not just about "if representation" but also "as whom". You are represented, but you are represented as the given role in a specific discourse realm. [@thomassen2017]

Does it mean that in a constructivist sense, you have been produced as subject to speak in behalf of the constructed role in that specific discourse the constructer is forming?

## Immanence and transcendence 

> Theorists of abundance are not content with existing pluralism, but pursue an active cultivation of difference – what Connolly calls pluralisation – through agonistic respect. It is a search for ways for society to be open to new ways of life not presently recognised.

# Actual

1.  There is a question of power in how a specific community forms itself to generate (in a sense) a political commonness.
2. The constructivist turn reveals that the relation of this constituency with its representative is not a unidirectional dimension, a constituency is also constructed by the representative.
3. This reveals there is always some not represented substance ready to be exploited in some sense.
4. AI is an entity of power, especially good at revealing connections hard to see otherwise.
5. This is a blessing and a curse at the same time?

Elective representation does not exhaust democratic representation [@saward2009, 4]. 

Every representation is constructed and formed by the extraction (our production) of binding latent qualities among the society
