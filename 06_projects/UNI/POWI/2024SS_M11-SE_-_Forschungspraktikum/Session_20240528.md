## Thinking the think piece
![[think_piece_-_Utku_B_Demir.pdf]]

First of all, universal history is the history of contingencies, and not a history of necessity. Ruptures and limits, not of continuity [@deleuze1983, 140].

### Idea 1:  The Algorithm as the optimal constructivist

- the individual is a collection of dividuals, and dividuals are parts of data (cheery-lippold)
- The constructivist uses in a sense the dividuals construct somehing
- But it is still a naive approach
- In a sense, every constructivist approach needs to de- and reterritorialise
- Capitalist machine is good at decoding and recoding
- The algorithm is much better at that, it sees something human cannot possibly see. 
- A schizo analysis is on the way, it will reterri. you through the probabilistic connections
- But your dividuals are only marketable as long as your dividuals are in the setting of this meta-narrative 
- So, the subaltern cannot speak
- We need schizo connections as humans to get out of that

Actually D&G offer a way to go out of or determined representations by schizo connections. Could the algorightm make it possible against Spivak?
### Idea 2: Rojava; Should we fear the Volonte Generale: A post-representation critique

**Tormey** 
Zapatistas represent not in behalf but with the people
GIving voice and speaking for them

> Assuming this to be the case, then what is curious is the degree to which political theory is still evidently wedded to the model of representation as a means for thinking about how communities can function or organise themselves. Rather than witnessing an emerging literature on ‘post-representation’, we see merely the remodelling of representation in ever more baroque fashion so that groups, minorities or diverse interests can be integrated into existing representative systems of governance.3

> Like Plato’s Pharmakon, representation has become both poison and cure, both a source of disaffection and the means for its overcoming. In my view this represents a failure of the normative imagination, an unwillingness to contemplate life ‘after’ representation.

> As we noted above, the representative function was deployed quite explicitly as a means of filling the hole of political authority created by the waning of temporal and religious authority. This in turn led to the problematic of early liberal thought: the state exists, how can it be legitimated? For liberals (and indeed non-liberals) the answer was to create a unified aggregate, The People, which could then be represented by those who govern.18 On a Deleuzo–Guattarian reading the figure of The People is, however, a ‘passive aggregate’ or ‘denumerable set’ like ‘the majority’, ‘the nation’ or ‘the young’. This is to say they are collective categories deployed rhetorically to justify actions without reference to the actual views of those who ‘compose’ the ‘it’ in question. ‘What The People want’, is not what people want, but rather what it is that someone thinks the people want. It is what the ‘representatives’ of The People’s interests want.

> Deleuze’s work on difference—is not then anarchy tout court, as if we could reach out in the manner of a Godwin, Proudhon or Kropotkin to some ideal state of affairs to supplant the rotten present. As Deleuze and Guattari make clear in A Thousand a t U n i v e r s i t y o f M i c h i g a n o n J u n e 1 8 , 2 0 1 5 h t t p : / / p a . o x f o r d j o u r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d f r o

146 Parliamentary Affairs Plateaus, the key question in moving ‘beyond’ representation is not ‘anarchy versus organisation’.22 Rather, it is supplanting practices that are concerned with articulating what ‘the majority’, whether actual or imagined, want or need. It is concerned with the dissolution of the ‘problematic’ of ‘minorities’ faced with ‘majorities’, of idiosyncrasy confronted by ‘the norm

**Thomassen** 
> This line of argument is distinguished from two positions, which both, in their different ways, lay claim to move beyond representation. There is first the claim to transparent representation, that is, to have truly represented someone or something as in the claims of certain political leaders to have a direct line to God, or as in the claim of certain political and intellectual leaders to have determined the true interest of the people. The potential dangers of this position are all too well known. A second position is the post-representational one taken by Tormey who wants to avoid the potential totalitarianism of the first position. Here the claim is that the people should be allowed to speak for themselves. Like the first position, however, the second one relies on what Derrida calls a ‘metaphysics of presence’, and in this case we may add that it is also a ‘metaphysics of immediacy’. It is linked to a set of hierarchical dualisms between autonomy and paternalism, authenticity and distortion, presence and representation, and immediacy and representation. Tormey places him

**What is speAking for themselves?** (SPIVAK)

> Precisely. The trouble with Tormey’s post-representational position is that it is ‘vain’ and therefore potentially dangerous because it overlooks the role of political and intellectual leadership in formulating what we, or the peoples of Chiapas, really are. Although—or because—Derrida does not claim to be able to let the downtrodden speak for themselves, the Derridean position acknowledges the constitutivity of representation and thereby focuses our attention on challenging particular acts of representation and pursuing what we believe to be better ones. Here I concur with Spivak when she writes of Derrida that ‘he is less dangerous ... than the first-world intellectual masquerading as the absent nonrepresenter who lets the oppressed speak for themselves’.35 In conclusion, what divides Tormey’s Deleuzean argument from the deconstructive argument espoused here is the constitutivity of representation. That, I believe, is the central dividing line among theorists of radical democracy and poststructuralist theorists with important implications for how one thinks about the political space and resistance, social identities and the role of leadership, as we have seen.
