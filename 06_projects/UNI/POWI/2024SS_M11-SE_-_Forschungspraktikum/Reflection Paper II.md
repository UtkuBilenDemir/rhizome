Starting y the Bolshevik example. At which point the effort of the Bolshevik was not the cultivation of the general opinion *out of the population* anymore, and turned into *manufacturing* a constituency (see ibid.)? One could also argue the best way of the public to realise their wishes in political representation is to help them to build those wishes. 

This approach constitutes the foundation of the constructivist turn. Going one step further the further claim would be without the careful construction of the public opinion, there is nothing to be represented or there is the raw material lying in the public which until crafted into a political entity it lacks substance, there can be no representation of it. Contrastingly to the previous definitions Disch's analysis introduces a more dynamic and proactive approach to representation. By advocating for the view of representatives as not just conveyors but creators of constituencies, Disch highlights the active role political actors play in shaping and defining the political landscape. This process of mobilisation and construction aligns with the "constructivist turn" in political representation, where representatives help in forming the very desires and needs of the constituencies they intend to represent. This active construction of public opinion and political identities suggests that without such efforts, what exists in the public domain may remai shapeless for political action. In other words, until these raw sentiments are organised and articulated into coherent political demands or identities, they lack the "substance" necessary for meaningful representation. The raw material of public sentiment, therefore, needs to be crafted into a political entity through deliberate and strategic mobilisation and articulation.

But this interactive understanding of representation is to be taken in a broader concept as mobilisation. The public interest s to be constituted not just by the political actors to gain/create representation but also by forming a social network directed to a specific goal. Disch emphasises that mobilisation should be seen as a formative process that not only gathers support but also defines and constructs political identities. (ibid. 19ff) This process includes not just traditional activities like canvassing or phone banking but also the rhetorical and policy-driven actions by political figures that shape how groups perceive their identities and interests. This reconceptualisation brings to light the dynamic interaction between political leaders and their constituents, where each influences the other in the ongoing construction of political reality. 

This interactive forms blurs the borders between a responsive/unresponsive representation and how much the representative delivers the interests of their constituency. A manifactured public opinion is meant to be close to the acts of its representation. On the other hand the concept of mobilisation also emphasises that every public opinion is formed/extracted in some way with societal movement, relieving the nature of the construction of a political entity.

Thomassen builds on Laclau's argument that political representation is not just a straightforward reflection of public interests or identities but is fundamentally performativ. It actively constructs the "people" it purports to represent [@thomassen2019, 329f]. Thomassen again emphasises that Laclau views representation as a constructivist process. This means that political actors, through the act of representation, do not merely mirror pre-existing public sentiments but actively participate in shaping those sentiments. Similar to Disch, Laclau breaks from traditional views that see representation as a correspondence between the citizens’ interests and the actions of their representatives. Instead, he suggests that representation involves constructing those very interests and identities through the political process. Thomassen highlights Laclau’s idea that representation is not a passive reflection but an active performance that brings into being the identities it purports to represent. This performative aspect is crucial in understanding how populism operates, as it constructs "the people" as a political actor through the process of representation itself.

Laclau links the rise of populism in this sense to a crisis in traditional representative systems where there is a perceived or real failure of these systems to adequately reflect the people's will (ibid. 330- 333). Populism, therefore, is seen as a direct response to the failures of the representation system, creating a space where unmet demands find a voice. Populism, in Laclau's view, exemplifies his theory of representation. Populists articulate particular demands that are not recognized within the formal political system, effectively constructing a political identity for "the people" that can encompass a wide array of grievances and demands. This process illustrates how political identities are not pre-given but shaped through political discourse and action. However, in this sense, the construction is not following how a public mobilisation would work, the populist is constructing a representative identity that would gravitate a constituency. The population is not forming themselves according to a specific interest discovered but appealing to an identity, a collection of procative interest brought together by the populist. It forces us to rethink the current approach in political representation.

The classical Marxist understanding of the representation in the context of the class struggle also getting crtiticism from Laclau. Laclau introduces the concept of articulation, distinguishing it from the traditional model of representation. Articulation is seen as performative—it actively shapes and constructs political and social identities through political discourse and strategy. This contrasts sharply with the Marxist view where representation is merely reflective. Laclau argues that representation is constitutive of social and political identities, not just reflective. This means representation itself helps form the groups and interests it represents, rather than merely depicting pre-existing groups or interests (ibid. 334 -338). 

For Thomassen, Laclau’s interpretation of populism is a critical lens through which to view representation. Laclau suggests that populism exposes the inherent performativity and constructiveness of political representation. Thomassen undelines that Laclau developed a more systematic theory in his later works, emphasising that representation, including populist representation, is performative and constitutive. Thomassen seems to align with Laclau’s notion that all politics is representational, and populism exemplifies this by illustrating how political identities and interests are not merely reflected but actively constructed and contested through political processes. Thomassen suggests that populism, while often critiqued for its potential to undermine democratic pluralism, can also reveal fundamental aspects of how democratic systems operate, including their inherent exclusions and the continuous contestation of identities within them.
