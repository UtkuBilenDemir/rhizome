> Historically, she argues, only centralized parties have proven capable of building solidarities that last.

> No salvation will come from outside existing society, they claim. But they agree with Dean about the untenability of left populism. Most notably, the theorist Chantal Mouffe and her late partner Ernesto Laclau isolate “the political” as an autonomous realm in which the people may constitute itself without confronting the social dynamics of neoliberalism. A real strength of Hardt and Negri’s analysis is its injunction against thinking that politics alone can solve all of our problems.

- [[@hardt2017]], 45 ==Neoliberalism undermines (destroys) the political==
> This is all true—in Europe and throughout the world. We object, however, to the reasoning that, since neoliberalism undermines the political, the only means—let alone the only effective or desirable means—to combat neoliberalism is to restore the autonomy of the political, that this kind of play of opposites defines our political possibilities.We contend that we have other options, and, specifically, a nonsovereign and truly democratic organization of society is possible. Instead of resurrecting the autonomy of the political, the political must flow back into and be reclaimed by the social: political rationality and political action can no longer be considered autonomous but always completely embedded in the circuits of social and economic life.

- ==Sovereignity is not needed==
>We find ourselves thrust back to the double bind of the Communards:their “error” of dismantling the central committee and distributing decision-making power to all leads to defeat, and yet not dismantling the central committee would negate the democratic nature of their entire project.This double bind, however, does not (and perhaps never did) define our political alternatives. Sovereignty is not required for political projects to be effective,to win,to take power. 

- 69 ==Multitude is this plurality (but they do not talk about the fractionalism) ==
> We use the term multitude to name the agent of this plural ontology. We have emphasized elsewhere that multitude designates a radical diversity of social subjectivities that do not spontaneously form together but instead require a political project to organize.8 Multitude, understood as a political project, is the hinge between the plural social ontology and the possibility of a real de­ mocracy.We cannot, however, fully understand this plural ontology or arrive at this political project if our vision remains fixed on the political terrain, even when we analyze the most powerful protests, rebellions, and uprisings. The movements themselves are only symptoms of a deeper social reality, embod­ ied in the daily practices and capacities of the multitude, and its circuits of social production and reproduction

- 83 ==Power==
> What, then, does “from below” mean? It means, first, defining power from the standpoint of the subordinated, whose knowledge is transformed through resistance and struggles of liberation from the domination of those “above.”Those below have a fuller knowledge of the social whole, a gift that can serve as the basis for a multitudinous enterprise of constructing the common. From below also designates a political trajectory: an institutional project that has not only the force to subvert command but also the capacity to construct politically an alternative society.

- 134 ==About leaderlessness==
> the critique of traditional forms of leadership should not be confused with a refusal of organization—is that the critique of modern administration must be accompanied by the creation of alternative administrative forms.The point is not to be done with Weber but to run Weber in reverse.This is why we have tried to highlight that the same subjectivities that throw modern bureaucracy into crisis also demonstrate the social and organizational capacities, the intelligence, knowledges, and access to information that are required for effective and autonomous social administration.15

> This Gezi Park moment, going from almost zero to a massive movement within days, clearly demonstrates the power of digital tools. However, with this speed comes weakness, some of it unexpected. First, these new movements find it difficult to make tactical shifts because they lack both the culture and the infrastructure for making collective decisions. Often unable to change course after the initial, speedy expansion phase, they exhibit a “tactical freeze.” Second, although their ability (as well as their desire) to operate without defined leadership protects them from co-optation or “decapitation,” it also makes them unable to negotiate with adversaries or even inside the movement itself. Third, the ease with which current social movements form often fails to signal an organizing capacity powerful enough to threaten those in authority.

- 1039 ==Vertretung/Repräsentation==
on the one hand, mandate representation, in which the representative is authorized by the represented, often to defend their interestan idea best captured by the German word Vertretung and, on the other hand, representation as embodiment, identified by the conceptual historian Hasso Hofmann as repraesentatio identitatis (Hofmann 1973), a medieval term used to designate situations in which a representative (often an assembly) could stand for an entity (a universitas, or corporation) without any mandate, simply by speaking as pars pro toto, a part for the whole—better corresponding to the initial meaning of the German word Repräsentation

> This extensive understanding of Saward’s representative claim, where every political statement or even any symbolic act, linguistic or not, relating different elements of the world, is said to be a representative claim, may be set in contrast with more limited conceptions of representative claims in which someone actually needs to make an explicit claim for representation to occur. In 2020, Thomás Zicman de Barros, discussing several popular upheavals, asserted that their political claims may have been representative in the aesthetic sense of Darstellung, but not necessarily of Vertretung, delegation, or mandate (de Barros 2020)—only to be strongly criticized by Lasse Thomassen, who in a more radically constructivist vein stated that claims about objects of representation always implicated a subject, thus a form of Vertretung (Thomassen 2021). This dichotomy has to be linked with another important one made by several scholars between radical and moderate constructivism (Fossen 2019; Hayat 2019; Mulieri 2019). According to the radical version of Saward’s constructivism, political or even social reality is entirely constructed by these claims: the structure of reality is only defined by the contingent success of the claims. In the moderate version, on the contrary, social reality preexists any claim, so the structure of the referent actually matters when it comes to the success or failure of the claims. This should be related with Pierre Bourdieu’s critique of the Marxian conception of social classes: Bourdieu advocated against Marx for a radical constructivism by refuting the idea that classes exist as economic realities before they are represented (Bourdieu 1991b). For a radical understanding of representative claims see (Decreus 2013). Also see (Thomassen 2017) for a discussion on representation and poststructuralism.

- 13 ==Citizen Sovereignity ==
> express their will directly through referendums. This apparent mismatch between the means and ends of the movement might stem from the predominance of newcomers to politics, unfamiliar with appropriate forms of protest. But this somewhat paternalistic argument only shifts the question: Why newcomers would enter politics on this occasion and claim to be the sovereign people? Maybe it is linked with the current transformations of representative democracy, and in particular the decreasing ability of citizens to make their voices heard by politicians. It is of paramount importance in a representative democracy to have the means for citizens to express a judgment on their representatives between elections. This is necessary for representation to function properly, as any representative system requires institutionalized forms of responsiveness (Pitkin, 1972), but also for specifically democratic reasons. As Nadia Urbani puts it, democratic representation requires that the “sovereign people retain a negative power that allows them to investigate, judge, influence and censure their lawmakers” (Urbinati, 2006, p. 28). Yet, in most representative governments, including the French Republic, parties are the only institutionalized means of organizing this citizen control (Manin, 1997). But when these parties are no longer trusted to accomplish this, citizens must resort to forms of direct interpellation of their representatives, not as party members, but as the constituents in their full generality.

- Their role—and this is largely how they had been seen and even constructed by the Jacobins (Burstin, 2005)—was not to replace the Assembly, but to monitor it, to ensure that deputies defended the general interest, not their own or that of the rich, and sometimes to be consulted on the laws that were passed.
