# NOTES

## Ankersmit

- Ankersmit claims there is an optimal politician whose expertise is the representation with the only intention to represent (S16), I've never seen this character.
- He overlooks what an agora type of engagement would actually elevate the public to and what kind of a lack it creates to not be involved this way.
- Modern subject is suffering from not having any kind of political power other than a mere representation. (S16)
- Representation is also fluid, parties would like to have a broader voter basis, so the representation gets ambigious.

## Runciman

David Runciman's analysis of Hobbes's theory of representation explores whether it can be considered anti-democratic or proto-democratic, revealing a complex view that straddles both interpretations. Runciman suggests that Hobbes's theory, while ostensibly anti-democratic due to its apparent endorsement of absolute sovereignty without direct accountability to the populace, also contains elements that are foundational for understanding modern representative democracy. Here's how Runciman argues that Hobbes's theory can be seen as supportive of democratic and representative principles:

1. **Foundational Role of Representation**: Hobbes is credited with modernizing the concept of political representation, making it a distinctly modern concept by separating the state as an entity from its medieval roots. This conceptual shift is foundational for modern theories of representative government.
    
2. **Distinction Between Authorization and Representation**: Hobbes makes a critical distinction between authorization (the process by which individuals grant authority to a sovereign) and representation (the manner in which the sovereign embodies the state itself). Runciman argues that understanding this distinction is key to reconciling Hobbes‚Äôs model with democratic expectations of representation. It shows that while Hobbes supports a sovereign that operates with considerable autonomy (seeming anti-democratic), the theory also acknowledges the role of the populace in authorizing this sovereignty, laying groundwork for a kind of representation.
    
3. **The Sovereign and the Commonwealth**: In Hobbes's theory, the sovereign does not represent the individual subjects' personal wills but represents the commonwealth as a whole. This idea that the sovereign embodies the collective will or identity of the state, rather than the disparate wills of individuals, can be seen as a proto-democratic concept because it shifts the focus from the ruler to the represented entity‚Äîthe state‚Äîas the primary subject of political action.
    
4. **Addressing the Pitfalls of Democracy**: Runciman suggests that by distinguishing between representation and authorization, Hobbes provides a framework that anticipates and addresses potential pitfalls in democratic governance, such as the fragmentation of authority or the tyranny of the majority. This framework can help ensure stability while maintaining a form of collective identity and decision-making, principles important to democratic governance.
    
5. **Hobbes's Skepticism and Creative Conception of Representation**: While Hobbes was skeptical about the viability of democracy as understood in his time, his theory offers a creative way of conceptualizing political representation that transcends simple categorization as anti-democratic. Runciman points out that Hobbes's skepticism led him to a theory of representation that, while not democratic in a modern sense, laid the groundwork for thinking about how a state can represent its people even in the absence of direct, democratic control over the sovereign.

In summary, Runciman's argument suggests that while Hobbes's theory appears anti-democratic due to its endorsement of an unaccountable sovereign, its nuanced understanding of representation and the state contains elements that are surprisingly congruent with democratic principles. These elements include the foundational role of representation in political theory, the distinction between authorization and representation, and a conceptual framework that allows for a collective political identity, all of which can be seen as contributing to the development of democratic thought.

## Boucoyannis

Deborah Boucoyannis's work, "Kings and Judges: Power, Justice, and the Origins of Parliaments," presents a compelling argument challenging traditional narratives on the emergence of representative institutions in medieval Europe. Rather than focusing on economic factors and the bargaining for taxation rights as the primary drivers for the development of parliaments, Boucoyannis emphasizes the role of justice administration and its demand as fundamental in shaping these early forms of representative governance. Here‚Äôs a deeper look into how Boucoyannis argues for a democratic and representative nature inherent in the demand for justice and its administration:

### 1. Justice as a Primary Demand

- **Fundamental Role of Justice**: Boucoyannis posits that the demand for justice, rather than economic or military pressures, played a crucial role in the establishment of early representative institutions. This demand stems from the ruler‚Äôs role as the principal dispenser of justice, highlighting a societal need for fair and accessible legal adjudication as a cornerstone for governance.

### 2. Ruler‚Äôs Role Beyond Extraction

- **Beyond Economic Extraction**: The narrative diverges from the conventional wisdom that kings and rulers were primarily focused on extracting resources from their subjects for warfare and other purposes. While acknowledging the extractive practices of roving monarchs, Boucoyannis points out that these rulers also played a critical role in dispensing justice, which was both sought after and valued by their subjects.

### 3. The Development of Representative Institutions

- **From Roving to Stationary Judges**: The transition from rulers who moved around the realm dispensing justice (roving judges) to a more stationary and structured form of justice administration underpins the evolution of representative governance. This shift towards a centralized system of justice not only made legal processes more efficient but also laid the groundwork for representative bodies that could oversee and participate in governance.

### 4. Inclusive and Effective Governance

- **Inclusive Integration under a Central Authority**: Boucoyannis argues that successful representative governance at the polity level was marked by the integration of diverse populations and territories under a stable, centralized authority. The provision and administration of justice served as a unifying force that helped integrate the realm, demonstrating an early form of democratic governance where the ruler's legitimacy was partly derived from their role as the supreme judge.

### 5. Representation Throughout Europe

- **Widespread Representation Practices**: Contrary to the view that parliamentary traditions were unique to specific geographies, Boucoyannis highlights the widespread presence of assemblies and representative practices across Europe. This ubiquity suggests a common demand for representation, not necessarily linked to taxation or economic factors, but possibly to a broader desire for justice and participation in governance.

### 6. Challenging the Taxation-Representation Nexus

- **Questioning the Primacy of Taxation in State-Building**: By focusing on justice as a central element in the development of representative institutions, Boucoyannis challenges theories that place taxation and economic bargaining at the heart of state-building processes. This perspective offers a fresh look at how democratic practices may have roots in the collective demand for justice, rather than economic leverage against the state.

In her analysis, Boucoyannis provides a nuanced understanding of the historical evolution of representative democracy, emphasizing the role of justice in fostering early democratic practices. By highlighting the demand for justice as a unifying and foundational element in governance, Boucoyannis contributes to a broader conception of democracy's origins, one that goes beyond economic factors to include the intrinsic human desire for fairness and representation in the administration of justice.
