An important distinction about how the will of people is crystallising in different political structures.

![[Pasted image 20240407225352.png]]
This is actually what we call **independence**, could be labeled as the appeal of state of nature.

But since Kant, we know that the freedom is something we produce, not something we either go back to or already obtain in the nature itself.

 As Rousseau also recognises here.

>[!quote] Where representation is conceived as being of unattached abstractions, the consultation of anyone's wishes or opinions is least likely to seem a significant part of representing. Burke did not think that representing had much to do with consulting the represented or doing what they wanted; that is because he was talking about the representation of unattached interests—interests to which no particular persons were so specially related that they could claim to be privileged to define the interest.

Representative is someone put in charge to define interest.

#### 211

>[!quote] If the representative is an ordinary, fallible man with no special knowledge or abilities, it seems highhanded and unjustifiable for him to ignore his constituents. Again the extremes are outside the concept altogether: a true expert taking care of a helpless child is no representative, and a man who merely consults and reflects without acting is not representing in the sense of substantively acting for others. But the intermediate range is broad.

#### 212
>[!quote]- 
>Political issues, by and large, are found in the intermediate range, where the idea of representing as a substantive acting for others does apply. Political questions are not likely to be as arbitrary as a choice between two foods; nor are they likely to be questions of knowledge to which an expert can supply the one correct answer. They are questions about action, about what should be done; consequently they involve both facts and value commitments, both ends and means.

>[!quote]-
>But this is precisely the kind of context in which representation as a substantive activity is relevant. For representation is not needed where we expect scientifically true answers, where no value commitments, no decisions, no judgment are involved. And representation is impossible (except in a formalistic or symbolic or descriptive sense) where a totally arbitrary choice is called for, where deliberation and reason are irrelevant. We need representation precisely where we are not content to leave matters to the expert; we can have substantive representation only where interest is involved, that is, where decisions are not merely arbitrary choices.

A little hard to understand. There are some issues which cannot be operationalised in a technical way?
#### 213
>[!quote]-
>We have said that the representative must pursue his constituents' interest, in a manner at least potentially responsive to their wishes, and that conflict between them must be justifiable in terms of that interest. But what becomes of terms like "interest" and "justifiable" if there can be lifelong, profound disagreement among men as to what their interest is—disagreement that remains despite deliberation and justification and argument? To the extent that this is so, the possibility of a substantive acting for others breaks down, and that view of the concept becomes irrelevant to politics.

So, the politician has to be at least partially responsible to the interest of the subjects they are representing. However, we do struggle with identifying interest on a broader scale.

#### 214
>[!quote]-
>Within any functioning representative system, the same considerations apply to the personality of the legislator and to the particular issue before him. A representative who characteristically feels sure of his own knowledge and convictions is more likely to act on them; one who tends to feel skeptical and cautious about his own views is more likely to want to know what his constituents think.

So the dilemma is if there is "technical profiency" the representative is more likely to act but won't be considering what the subjects think. And the vice versa is the case if they are skeptical and cautious.

##### But, what is to be represented? Is it objectively determinable?

#### 215
>[!quote]-
>Furthermore, the representative who is an elected legislator does not represent his constituents on just any business, and by himself in isolation. He works with other representatives in an institutionalized context at a specific task—the governing of a nation or a state. This reintroduces the familiar problem of local or partial interests versus the national interest, and the question of the political representative's role with respect to them.

So the nature of the representation is rhizomatic in a sense. It has more to do with the network of representatives, organisations they have been subjected to but also the demography of the coalition, current network of representative bodies than their direct connection to the constituents.

The obvious question:
>[!quote]
>If a man represents a particular constituency in the legislature, is his duty to pursue its interest or the interest of the nation as a whole?

**Answer**
>[!quote]
>And, in a practical sense, it is politically and socially important that local and partial interests not be allowed to outweigh the needs and interests of the nation as a whole.

#### 218
Is the combination of all parts is the whole?
>[!quote]- 
>About final-objective-interest one could say that the interest of the parts adds up to the interest of the whole, but such an optimistic formula must not be allowed to obscure the obvious conflicts in initial-interest-claim. Politics entails the reconciliation of conflicting claims, each usually with some justice on its side; the harmony of final-objective-interests must be created.

So, it must become a national good? What is the role of representative here?
>[!quote]
>The representative is, typically, both special pleader and judge, an agent of his locality as well as a governor of the nation.

#### 220
The challenges of the legislator:
>[!quote]
> 1. while it may be difficult to determine the interest
or wishes of a single individual, it is infinitely more difficult to do so for a constituency of thousands. On many issues a constituency may not have any interest, or its members may have several conflicting interests.13 And the representative knows of the voters' ignorance and apathy and irrationality, the diversity of their views and interests. Further, he seldom has access to accurate information about what views and interests they do have.
> 2. To act effectively he must keep in mind not only the formal and informal rules of his legislative body but also its place in the whole structure of government.(and other representatives) 
> 3. In the third place, he will also have views and opinions, at least on some issues. He will feel that some measures are intrinsically unsound, immoral, or undesirable.

#### 222
>[!quote]
>The majority of my constituents occasionally lack knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances. For me not to take this into account would be a violation of my oath of office as a legislator, not to mention my obligation to my own conscience, judgment and sense of duty.

What distincts a representative from a lawyer is that he also have to abide to the environment of other politicians and the landscape of the different organisations in the legislative body.

#### 226
It is therefore more important how those components work with each other than merely focusing of how each agent deploys the representation.

>[!quote]-
>Think of the same body as a symbol and you will almost inevitably be more concerned with its psychological impact on the minds of the people than with any accuracy of correspondence between it and the nation. Think of it, in turn, as an agent or collection of agents, and your interest will focus on other concerns. Thus it is necessary to know what each view implies and assumes, and which view is appropriate under the circumstances.

#### 228
**On the authority**
>[!quote]-
>It is sometimes argued, particularly by authorization theorists, that every government represents its subjects in the sense that it has authority over them and makes laws for them.26 Governments do have that authority; the authority to make laws seems part of the very meaning of government. Yet authority is not coextensive with representation; one need not represent in order to have authority to issue orders. But a government also acts in the name of its subjects. Thus a slightly modified position would be that all governments represent in the formalistic sense that their actions not only bind their subjects but are attributed to these subjects.

>[!quote]-
>The will on which a government rests may be democratic, even if oligarchic or plutocratic influences are powerful in creating it. It is quite possible that an interested minority may so control the avenues of information and suggestion that a majority will suffer persuasion contrary to their own interests. The decision of a leader may induce millions to support measures which they would have opposed if his prestige had been thrown to the other side.

#### 232
>[!quote] On Despotism
>If support for the regime is manufactured by way of a monopoly of control over the media of mass communication, supplemented by severe coercion against oppositional elements. ... If a political regime relies heavily on a highly organized propaganda monopoly, . . . and ruthlessly suppresses all political dissent, one must conclude that no amount of evidence of public support to the regime can prove that the people's genuine interests are not being exploited in the interest of the ruling few.
>By the same token, no amount of public support can then prove that the government is a representative one. When a ruler manipulates an inert mass of followers to accord with his will, we hesitate to say that he represents them. In the same way, if an interest group engages in a vast propaganda campaign to persuade the public in favor of some measure, we do not regard this activity as representation of the public.

#### 233 
The government has to have some kind of responsiveness to claim to be representative to some extent.
(Kelsen, 2017; Pitkin, 1967)
>[!quote]-
>to the contrary. There need not be a constant activity of responding, but there must be a constant condition of responsiveness, of potential readiness to respond. It is not that a government represents only when it is acting in response to an express popular wish; a representative government is one which is responsive to popular wishes when there are some. Hence there must be institutional arrangements for responsiveness to these wishes.

This responsiveness is to be guaranteed by the institutional structures.

*Pitkin is however do not mention the concept of legitimacy*

#### 234
**When do we say a government is representative?**
>[!quote]
>We do not say that a government is representative today, because it happens to be responding to popular wishes, and stops being representative the next day because it is frustrating them. Representative government is not defined by particular actions at a particular moment, but by long-term systematic arrangements—by institutions and the way in which they function. No particular act of compliance with popular demands is proof of a representative government, although a few serious cases of the frustration of legitimate popular demands will serve as counterevidence.

Even a non-binding institutionalisation deploys responsiveness to some extent. Therefore Charles the I. was that eager to dissolve a parliament which didn't even have any kind of authority.

**prerequisites**
>[!quote]-
>our basic prerequisites seem very few. We would be reluctant to consider any system a representative government unless it held regular elections, which were "genuine" or "free."36 We would be reluctant, further, to consider a government representative unless it included some sort of collegiate representative body in a more than advisory capacity.37 We would not readily accept a system as representative in which the entire government was in the hands of a single ruler, even if he was subject to reelection at regular intervals. Perhaps it is merely historical tradition that there should be a collegiate body composed of representatives of the various "parts" of the society.
#### 236
So, the institutional structures are there to ensure the democratic process and the legitimacy of the representative governance. However, developing fixed ways of doing something, "institutionalised behaviour" might become habitual and lose its flexibility to adapt itself to changing conditions. So, a system without the ability of **self reflection** and change cannot deploy a legitimate representation in the long term. This can be thought to be an *institutional responsiveness* instead of the individual responsiveness of individual representatives or political parties.

#### 240
>[!quote] Summary
>Rather, it should present a continuing but not hopeless challenge: to construct institutions and train individuals in such a way that they engage in the pursuit of the public interest, the genuine representation of the public; and, at the same time, to remain critical of those institutions and that training, so that they are always open to further interpretation and reform.

> 1. Representation involves a principal-agent relationship (the representatives ‘stood for’ and ‘acted on behalf of’ the represented), mostly although not exclusively on a territorial basis, so that governments could be said to be responsive to the interests and opinions of the people constituted by territorial membership. 
> 2. Representative roles have specified places within political decision-making structures, formalised in constitutional law. Representation identifies locations for political power to be exercised responsibly and with a degree of accountability, in large part by enabling citizens to have some influence upon and exercise some control over it. 
> 3. The right to vote for representatives provides a simple means and measure of political equality, comprised as distributed empowerments to select and recall.

> [!quote]- 22
> oblematise large-scale, mass democratic institutions. Yet contemporary democracies have evolved in ways that increasingly undermine the adequacy of the standard model. Two of these involve the scale and complexity in processes of decision-making in modern societies: 
> 1. The emergence of transnational decision-making arenas, where new international and global players operate, tends to escape the reach of territorially democratic representation, as do the increasing number of issues that are non-territorial in nature (Rehfeld 2005; Grant and Keohane 2005; Bohman 2007). 
> 2. An increasing number of collective decision-making areas and issues, at both the national and supranational level, are now under the control of specialised and expert bodies, with only loose connections to the traditional institutions of political representation, and often lacking a place for the voice, influence and control of those affected (Zolo 1992; Beck 1997; Brown 2006).

Actually, Kant was saying that the international politics is just anarchy.

> [!quote]- 23
> Two other changes have to do with the ways people relate to their political communities: 
> 1. The simple political egalitarianism on which the institutions and mechanisms of modern representative democracy were established has given way to increasing demands for group recognition as well as for forms of equality related directly to people’s needs, characteristics, identities and conditions (Taylor 1994; Phillips 1995; Williams 1998; Young 2000). These developments have produced 5937_Disch.indd 22 .i 12/12/18 4:54 P
> a more complex discourse of representation, for which simple egalitarian standards embedded in the standard model no longer seem adequate.
> 2. There has been a diffusion of more informal structures and opportunities for democratic representation and influence. This development partly reflects the diminished role of formal political structures in social decision-making, but also the increasing diversification of the forms of association in modern societies, post-material ideals and culture, as well as increasingly dense and complex forms of public discourse (Beck 1997; Offe 1996; Warren 2001).
