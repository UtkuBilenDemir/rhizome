### Strengthening and creating new democratic institutions 

> [!question] How do we make democracy more resilient?

> [!question] What and how much regulation do we need?

#### 1. AI as an catalyser in showing cracks: Is democracy already in trouble ?
> [!idea] 
> We first need to talk about the current perception of the democracy.

> [!info] 70
> - Move away from the thin conception of democracy as a voting procedure..
> - What is democracy actually in republican, Enlightenment, and deliberative approaches? Includes participation, public deliberation, and social communication

#### 3. Building something new: institutional change, new institutions, paradigm shift in democracies 
- **Current dissatisfaction in political institutions**: 
- Transforming institutions into a more participative, and communicative direction.

- Examples:
	- Landemore (2020) open mini public: jury of selected citizens who deliberate and make the laws 
	- **Citizens' Assemblies**: Used in Ireland to discuss issues like abortion and climate change.
	- **Participatory Budgeting**: Porto Alegre, Brazil â€“ citizens decide on the allocation of part of the municipal budget.
- However, nowadays is lots of expertise is needed, it makes harder to establish a forum based representation or a direct democratic decision system. It also emphasises one of the important aspects, why people lose their trust in political institutions, because they are also more often than not failing to deliver this expertise. 

- Is what Guererro (2014) calls lottocracy sustainable? Are these approaches any more prone to populism, extremism? Does these perform better in case of disinformation, post-truth threats?
- Could AI help with the challenges in more community based, bottom up representation systems?

#### 4. Constitutional adaptation

- Structural transformation in constitutional order to 
	- empower democratically elected institutions over political elites or tech billionaires in decision-making including AI-related issues,
	- integration of the individual liberties together with a direction toward common good,
	- better procedures in dispute settlement between citizens,
	- more power to the people and their democratic institutions regarding the issues affecting us globally like climate change (more about this in the following sections) 
#### 5. Post-truth, and journalism as institution
- *Responsibilities as the 4. branch of the government:* critically reflecting on the government, educating the public.
- A challenging new era of misinformation
- AI can also assist journalism

### Regulation and Oversight

> [!idea] 
> The argument of techno-solutionism regarding the current developments under AI brings us to a similar challenge like the other global issues we are facing. Like in the case global warming, we, as the people, are feeling powerless against the private entities deciding unilaterally without or lacking involvement of democratic institutions and/or any democratic decision making process. This is an opportunity see the cracks in the global operation in liberal democracies. We cannot leave our. fates to private entitites.

> [!idea] 
> Coecklebergh mentions that the ethical criteria is also used for *ethics washing*. We have to delve into this as well, because just throwing ethical terms onto the table doesn't help and most-likely to be help laissez-faire. Non-legislation is as he notes, undemocratic.

> [!idea] Reflect institutions critically

> [!question] Should the technology be democritised? Shared or publicly owned?

> [!question] What does AI mean in the context of environmental challenges?

> [!quote] 
> Even from a free market perspective, it does make sense to dismantle monopolies to tackle these issues

> [!quote]
> without the coordination on supranational level, regulation does not make sense.

> [!question] How to establish a democratic supranational decision making process/institution?

### Democratic AI

> [!quote] Technology is never neutral
