## Ideas

### Public Sphere Idea

“organized as processes of communication where humans inform themselves, debate, and take collectively binding decisions” (2023: 12). This requires a public sphere: a social sphere where people can freely discuss political problems and thus form a public and a public opinion. — location: [678]() ^ref-37923

### Liberty

the rule of law, rather than the rule of men, is meant to secure liberty against domination (Sellers 2015). — location: [910]() ^ref-36030

### Authoritarianism

Zeng (2020) has argued that it is not AI itself that is the problem but rather AI in combination with, for example, ideological components. But there is no such thing as “AI itself” anyway. AI is always linked with other human systems. Here my claim is that AI – as used by humans and integrated with other systems – does not only erode democracies but also strengthens already existing forms of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, thus violating the principles of freedom and fraternity, and rendering application of republican and Enlightenment democratic ideals, such as tolerance and the public sphere, impossible. — location: [1095]() ^ref-12489

This also has a knowledge dimension: totalitarianism impacts knowledge in society. — location: [1144]() ^ref-17198
### U

Nomadic citizen subjectification to make humans immune to the echo chambers?

we learn to develop ourselves and we develop ourselves as a community. — location: [692]() ^ref-49744
