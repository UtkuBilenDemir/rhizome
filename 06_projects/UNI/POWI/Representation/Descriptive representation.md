# Descriptive representation

**Definition**:

Occurs when representatives **physically resemble** or share characteristics (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, religion) with the group they represent.

**Key Features**:

- Concerned with **who the representatives are**, not necessarily what they do.

- Assumes that representatives who share lived experiences with a group are better positioned to understand and advocate for that groupâ€™s interests.

**Example**:

Electing women to parliament to better reflect the gender composition of the population.

**Limitations**:

- Descriptive representation alone does not guarantee substantive outcomes.

- Critics argue it risks essentializing identities, assuming that shared characteristics automatically align with shared interests.
