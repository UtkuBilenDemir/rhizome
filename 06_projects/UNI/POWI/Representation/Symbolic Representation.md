# Symbolic Representation

**Definition**:

Relates to the **psychological and emotional aspects** of representation—how constituents perceive and feel represented by their representatives.

**Key Features**:

- Representation is seen as a **symbolic relationship** where representatives inspire trust, legitimacy, or pride in their constituents.

- Constituents’ perceptions matter more than the actions of the representative.

**Example**:

A president or national figurehead seen as a unifying symbol of the nation’s values or identity.

**Limitations**:

- Symbolic representation does not necessarily translate into substantive actions.

- It may result in superficial gestures that lack meaningful policy impact.
