# Substantive Representation

**Definition**:

Focuses on the **actions and policies** of representatives—whether they advocate for and advance the interests of the represented group.

**Key Features**:

- Representation is defined by **what the representative does**, rather than who they are.

- Representatives are judged based on their ability to **act for the interests** of their constituents.

**Example**:

A legislator who champions policies benefiting women’s rights or environmental justice, regardless of their personal identity.

**Tension with Descriptive Representation**:

Substantive representation may occur without descriptive representation (e.g., a male legislator effectively advancing women’s interests).
