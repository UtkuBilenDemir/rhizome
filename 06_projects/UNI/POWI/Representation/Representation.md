# Representation

Are we missing the referent (referant in Nöth, and referent in Saward), or in a Deleuzian sense, the referent is getting bounded, shaped and subsumed by the BOW, which in this case is the capital

> [!quote] Saussurean Representation
> To semioticians in the structuralist tradition, the idea of self-reference is not as paradoxical as it seems. In a way, structuralist semiotics in the Saussurean tradition conceives of the sign as a structure that is only constituted by other signs and, hence, can never really represent anything that is nonsemiotic. Since the world beyond the signs, according to Saussure, is a mere nebula, signs can only be signs in opposition to other signs, and representation is not the representation of the world, but the representation of a difference between signs [@noth2003, 13].
