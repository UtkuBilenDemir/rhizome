Restaurants for dinner

Well known for celebrities - restaurante asador casa Juan. Really Nice service. 

Cool and trendy one also nice music with Dj  -Papúa 

-amazónico 

-abanera 

For a nice paella - arroceria bahía 

There is another one what is so famous because is the oldest restaurante in the world hahaha - restaurante botín 

If you want to visit food market- Mercado de San Miguel. From here you can pop in to a diferentes bars which I would totally recommend but I will take this route.

From preciados street al the way down... but I will suggest have a look in the map. 

1- Casa labra (croquetas de bacalao)

2- Restaurante el Ñeru. You must order a draft sidra and they will give a tapa. 

3- Bar la campana or el ideal (both are together). This one is for bocadillo de calamares and patatas bravas. If there is not space bcos is so busy just take your sandwich and eat it in plaza mayor just chilling. 

4- just nearby you must go to - la casa del champiñón. Only mushroom with Serrano ham... order a plate and a beer and that all. 

(In from you have mercado de San Miguel a bit fancy and expensive but you can get also oyster) 

5- if you wanna go all the way down and still jumó in from one bar to another you should go next to la Latina neighborhood and visit 

6- Bar zepelín. Amazing bar to order whatever you feel like. 

7- nearby you will get my favorite one just for sardinas y cazón en adobo. Bar Santurce. This one is a must just for sardinas. Next door there is a shop where o my sells olives so just order plastic glass to go with your choice of olivas. 

Around this area you will find the Rastro market what is only happening on Sunday. 

Nearby to this area there is also the retiro park. Where you can visit and chill after a long day 😂 

Don’t forget that all the bars I mentioned is only to jump from one to another. So just order a small beer with a tapa to share and once is done go to another. 

If you wanna go to a roof top bar also in center of madrid. Hotel Riu Plaza España, 360º Rooftop. 

I hope it works for you!! 

Enjoy madrid buddy
