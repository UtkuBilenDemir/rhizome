# Difference
> Following Heidegger, Deleuze points out that since at least the pre-Socratic Parmenides Western philosophy has favoured unity, stability and sameness over diversity, change and difference. The result of this philosophical choice was, Deleuze avers, a “dogmatic image of thought” (1994, 131) according to which difference has for the most part been conceived in negative terms as what is not the same, not unified, not universal. In the dogmatic image of thought, difference has in other words always been made subject to identity [[@kruger2021]], 173
