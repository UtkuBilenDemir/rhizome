Oedipus is injected into unconscious, it appropriates the desiring production as if it was emanating from itself [see @deleuze1983, 56]. 

<mark class="hltr-gray">> [!quote] 
> no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised. [@deleuze1983, 126]</mark>

<mark class="hltr-gray"><mark class="hltr-grey">Actually, the discovery of the productive unconscious by Freud leads to its two correlates;
- on the one side, there is the confrontation between the *desiring-production* and *the social production* with their **identical natures with different regimes**
- , on the other side, the repression the social machine applies on desiring-machines -> psychic repression & social repression.
This all gets lost when the Oedipus becomes sovereign [see @deleuze1983, 54]</mark></mark>

> [!quote] 
> The schizo-there is the enemy! Desiring-production is personalized, or rather personologized (personnoiogisee), imaginarized (imaginarisee), structuralized. (We have seen that the real difference or frontier did not lie between these terms, which are perhaps complementary.) Production is reduced to mere fantasy production, production of expression. The unconscious ceases to be what it is-a factory, a workshop-to become a theater, a scene and its staging. And not even an avant-garde theater, such as existed in Freud's day (Wedekind), but the classical theater, the classical order of representation. [@deleuze1983, 54]

D&G identify 5 **paralogisms** that are wrong in the psychoanalysis:
## 1. extrapolation (connective synthesis?):
Psychoanalysis treats a detachable partial object (penis) as if it was a detached complete object, namely the phallus. From which all subjects derive by power of its attribution of lack. For women, it is what they desire/envy and for men their destination but they cannot obtain it because a full body of phallus is not achievable, the projection on phallus as a power symbol becomes mythical. The mythical Phallus is introducing lack to the desiring-production as the both sexes lack it for different reasons.
### The connective synthesis: either…or…or
Oedipal, exclusive and depressive. Anoedipal, inclusive and schizoid. There are 2 uses of the connective synthesis:
- a global use, specific use
- a partial use, nonspecific use

Oedipus replaces the partial objects with complete persons, partial objects with daddy-mummy-me and more, Oedipus replaces the very accumulation of desire, formation of the partial objects in a connective synthesis. A regime for the pairing of people instead of the connection of the partial objects under the rule of familial reproduction [see @deleuze1983, 71].

> [!important] 
> There we have a curious paralogism implying a transcendent use of the syntheses of the unconscious: we pass from detachable partial objects to the detached complete object, from which global persons derive by an assigning of lack. For example, in the capitalist code and its trinitary expression, money as detachable chain is converted into capital as detached object, which exists only in the fetishist view of stocks and lacks.[ @deleuze1983, 73]

This follows up to the unsticking of the social field from the production of desire. And reducing the production onto the space of oedipus. It is not like there is no oedipal sexuality, the thing is there is also anoedipal ones. And the signs of desire do not let themselves to be extrapolated.

## 2. double bind (disjunctive synthesis?): 

> [!quote] 
> And yet, as we have seen, if there is one problem that does not exist in schizophrenia, it is the problem of identifications. And if getting well amounts to getting oedipalized, we can easily understand the outbursts of the patient who "does not want to be cured," and who treats the analyst as one of the family, then as an ally of the police. Is the schizophrenic sick and cut off from reality because he lacks Oedipus, because he "is lacking" in something only to be found in Oedipus-or on the contrary is he sick by virtue of the oedipalization he is unable to bear, and around which everything combines in order to force him to submit (social repression even before psychoanalysis)? [@deleuze1983, 91]

Family is oedipalising; either you accept oedipal identity and suffer it as a crisis, or you get a lack of oedipal identity as a different kind of perversion blocking the productive unconscious regardless [see @buchanan2008e, 69]. If you don't follow the lines of differentiation mommy-daddy-me, you will fall into the dark pit of indifferentiated [see @deleuze1983, 78]. Oedipus makes the person hop between different *global persons*, it doesn't allow differentiating rules and differential persons.

> [!quote] 
> And everybody knows what psychoanalysis means by resolving Oedipus: internalizing it so as to better rediscover it on the outside, in social authority, where it will be made to proliferate and be passed on to the children. 'The child becomes a man only by resolving the Oedipus complex, whose resolution introduces him into society, where he finds, within the figure of Authority, the obligation to relive it, this time with no way out. [@deleuze1983, 79]

The oedipus forces us to an undecidable situation, you accept or negate it, you are in trouble. Only way to get out of it is the rejection of both problem and the solution. Schizoanalysis is not a solution to the oedipus complex, it is a system for de-oedipalisation. Psychoanalysis is not doomed though, D&G believe an internal reversal could turn it into a revolutionary force [see @deleuze1983, 82]. 

## 3. application (conjunctive synthesis?): 
 The problem is that psychoanalysis fixes the social field as a point of departure, and the family as a point of destination and whole social field is perceived through childhood [see @buchanan2008e, 69] . We are sick from the childhood, very christian. Everything is squashed, grounded, triangulated into Oedipus, reduced to father; is really all the figures of history dependent on oedipal analogy [see @deleuze1983, 89]? Is the schizophrene sick and cut off from the reality because he lacks Oedipus? --What he is lacking is only to be found again in Oedipus. On the contrary, he is sick by the virtue of oedipalisation he is unable to bear, and around which everything combines in order to force him to submit (social repression even before psychoanalysis)[@deleuze1983, 91]? 

The parental figures are in no way organisers, the essence of the whole operation unfolds as follows

> [!quote] 
> to fuse madness with a parental complex, to link it to "the half-real, half-imaginary dialectic of the Family"; to constitute for the madman a microcosm symbolizing "the massive structures of bourgeois society and its values," relations of Family-Child, Transgression-Punishment, Madness-Disorder; to arrange things so that disalienation goes the same route as alienation, with Oedipus at both ends; to establish the moral authority of the doctor as Father and Judge, Family and Law; and finally to culminate in the following paradox: "While the victim of mental illness is entirely alienated in the real person of his doctor, the doctor dissipates the reality of the mental illness in the critical concept of madness."* Luminous pages. [@deleuze1983, 93]

The political, cultural, world-historical, and racial content is left behind, crushed in the Oedipal treadmil, the family is being treated as a matrix, microcosm *justified*, *legitimised* in itself [see @deleuze1983, 95]. The shaping and delegation of the family by the macro order of production and power is disregarded. The father and mother, however, exist only as fragments, and are never organised into a figure or a structure ble both to represent the unconscious, and to represent in the various agents of the collectivity, all of them are coupled to the elements of the political and historical situation [@deleuze1983, 97].

ALL OF THESE ARE DICTATED BY POLITICS. Schizoanalysis therefore a political and social psychoanalysis. Family is just a mediator as best. 

From the moment of the initiation of the Oedipus complex all the collective agents will be interpreted as derivatives of, or substitutes for the parental figures, a system of equivalence that rediscovers itself everywhere [@deleuze1983, 101]. Everything is reduced into Oedipus (funny that we always discover afterwards an agent was the image of daddy or mommy ) by the means of *application*.

Society itself becomes the triangulation of the psychoanalysis, rather the triangle is applied to the society, and not vice versa.

> [!Warning] 
> And it is not the forms of the subjugated group that depend on Oedipal projections and identifications, but the reverse: it is Oedipal applications that depend on the determinations of the subjugated group as an aggregate of departure and on their libidinal investment (from the age of thirteen I've worked hard, rising on the social ladder, getting promotions, being a part of the exploiters). There is therefore a segregative use of the conjunctive syntheses of the unconscious, a use that does not coincide with divisions between classes, although it is an incomparable weapon in the service of a dominating class: it is this use that brings about the feeling of "indeed being one of us," of being part of a superior race threatened by enemies from outside. Thus the Little White pioneers' son, the Irish Protestant who commemorates the victory of his ancestors, the fascist who belongs to the master race. [@deleuze1983, 103-104]
>
> The subjugated group is associating themselves with a group of higher order in the hierarchy through the application of the Oedipus to some extent. Oedipus relies on this articulation. *It is not father applied to the boss, it is the boss applied to the father*[@deleuze1983, 104]
>
> That is why, when subjects, individuals, or groups act manifestly counter to their class interests-when they rally to the interests and ideals of a class that their own objective situation should lead them to combat-it is not enough to say: they were fooled, the masses have been fooled. It is not an ideological problem, a problem of failing to recognize, or of being subject to, an illusion. It is a problem of desire, and desire is part of the infrastructure. Preconscious investments are made, or should be made, according to the interests of the opposing classes. But unconscious investments are made according to positions of desire and uses of synthesis, very different from the interests of the subject, individual or collective, who desires. \[…\] ==A form of social production and reproduction, along with its economic and financial mechanisms, its political formations, and so on, can be desired as such, in whole or in part, independently of the interests of the desiring-subject.==[@deleuze1983, 104]

==DESIRE CAN BE MADE TO DESIRE ITS OWN REPRESSION! [@deleuze1983, 104]==

## 4. fictitious desire (how Oedipalisation takes a hold of the unconscious):
Oedipus complex says, you are not gonna marry your mother and kill your father, so we repeat "so, that's what I wanted all along". Law prohibits something that is completely fictitious to in the order of desire to persuade its subjects that they jad intention corresponding to the fiction [see @buchanan2008e, 70]. Desire is not faulty it becomes this only because it is repressed, in its core the desire is revolutionary.  Desurire thbecomes this is noaot faulyty it becomes this only because it is represesed, in its core the diesire is revolutionary. ==> This process shames the desire.

Repression cannot function without the repleacement of desire, without giving rise to a *consequent desire*, Oedipus is an idea in the service of repression (formed and molded by it) [@deleuze1983, 115].

## 5. desiring-production 
Desiring-production is an affirmative process defines the operation of the unconscious not lack [@buchanan2008e, 66]. Oedipus is a reactive formation, reacting to the desiring-production and cannot be considered in isolation [see @deleuze1983, 129]

> [!quote] 
> Recognizing the desire is ta~tamount to se.tting desiring-production back into motion on the body without organs, m the very place to which the schizo had retreated in order to silence and suffocate this production. This recognition of desire this position of desire, thiS-Sign refers to an order of real and actual pr~ducti:,ity that is not to be confused with an indirect or symbolic satisfaction, and that, in its stops as in its starts, is as distinct from a pre-oedipal regression as from a progressive restoration of Oedipus.[@deleuze1983, 130]

> [!quote] 
> The contrary should be said: neither is there anything in common between the two sexes, nor do they cease communicating with each other in a transverse mode where each subject possesses both of them, but with the two of them partitioned off, and where each subject communicates with one sex or the other in another subject. Such is the law of partial objects. Nothing is lacking, nothing can be defined as a lack; nor are the disjunctions in the unconscious ever exclusive, but rather the object of a properly inclusive use that we must analyze. [@deleuze1983, 60]

They offer counter theses regarding the mechanism of family:
1. the family is not the primary object of desire
2. the family is the agent, and not the cause of psychic repression
3. the family is an inductor not an organiser
4. the family is the origin of the state's hold over us

## Two Forms of Repression: Psychic Repression (refoulement) & Social Repression (répression)

- Psychic Repression
	- Unconscious
	- Internally applied
	- "the role of psychic repression is to teach us to  desire social repression."
	- "it is the family that 'is the delegated agent of psychic repression, or rather the agent delegated to  psychic repression"
- Social Repression
	- Conscious 
	- psychical apparatus knowingly applies to the desires

> [!quote] 
> Freud puts Oedipus before culture, before history; every  child, regardless of sex, irrespective of where or when they are born,  despite all differences of culture, religion, ethnicity, race, class, education and parenting, must resolve their desire to replace mummy or  daddy (depending on sex) in their relation with the parent of the  opposite sex. Achieving this is the principal aim or function of  psychic repression as psychoanalysis conceives it. Social repression,  on the Freudian view of things, conies to bear later, in a secondary  fashion, to keep in check the manifold 'returns of the repressed'  psychic repression is liable to. [@buchanan2008e, 71]
>
>
>
>The question might arise at this point - if psychic repression is  an instrument of social repression then why speak of two repressions, why not say there is one form of repression and be done with  it? Very simply put, the role of psychic repression is to teach us to  desire social repression. In our society, it is the family that 'is the delegated agent of psychic repression, or rather the agent delegated to  psychic repression5, and 'the incestuous drives are the disfigured  image of the repressed' (AO, 130/142). The family is the agent of Oedipalization, but not the cause. It creates the necessary conditions  for Oedipalization and ensures their perpetuation.

==Then, what is a **real desire** if the repression also desired?==

Psychic repression is such that the social repression is desired. 
>Social production would need at its disposal, on the recording surface of the socius, an agent that is also capable of acting on, of inscribing the recording surface of desire. Such an agent exists: the family. It belongs essentially to the recording of social production, as a system of reproduction of the producers. And doubtless, at the other pole, the recording of desiring-production on the body without organs is brought about through a genealogical network that is not familial: parents only intervene here as partial objects, flows, signs, and agents of a process that outflanks them on all sides. At most, the child innocently "relates" to his parents some part of the astonishing productive experience he is undergoing with his desire; but this experience is not related to them as such.

D&G never claims that psychoanalysis invented Oedipus, merely observed it.

> [!quote] 
> the repressive social formation delegates its power to an agent of psychic repression, and correlatively the repressed desire is as though masked by the faked displaced image to which the repression gives rise. Psychic repression is delegated by the social formation, while the desiring-formation is disfigured, displaced by psychic repression. \[…\]  [@deleuze1983, 119]
, 

## The Family
The family is not guilty, only indifferent, and reflector, transmitter. Not a powerful enough institution to bind everything to itself, we something more powerful more subterranean, something more than even psychoanalysis, and ideology combined with family. Very powerful forces needed to defeat the forces of desire, its autonomous revolutionary character. Oedipus is just an application and family is a delegated agent [@deleuze1983, 122].
## The micropolitics of desire#
Desiring-production can follow 2 paths:
1. Illegitimate conformist (neurotic, sedentary):  global and specific syntheses of connection, exclusive or restrictive syntheses of disjunction and segregative and biunivocal syntheses of consumption. 
2. Legitimate nonconformist (schizo, nomadic): comprised of partial and non-specific syntheses of connection, inclusive or non-restrictive syntheses of disjunction, and nomadic or polyvocal syntheses of consumption [@buchanan2008e, 72]

> Schizoanalytic cure starts by tracing a line back to the productive unconscious, to t he syntheses of desire because it is only there that is possible to bring about the necessary reversal of illegitimate syntheses, and the restoration of legitimate syntheses [@buchanan2008e, 72]. (At the end, Oedipus always comes later, it is imposed later)

## Illegitimate Syntheses
### **The illegitimate connective synthesis**
happens when a specific outcome imposed to connective synthesis, the synthesis derives to the desired outcome as if it was its natural advancement. Coming back to the example of *Jaws* by Buchanan, the lack of "community spirit" was lacking only because the community didn't need it any other time, the shark in this sense was the only lacking thing as the "common enemy". So, a proper schizo situation through trauma to arrive at a protper renunciation of desire and a weary resignation before the law [see @buchanan2008e, 73-77].

### **The illegitimate synthesis of disjunction** 
is starting with the oedipal complex' assumption that the only possibility for the subject to differentiate is the adoption of daddy-mommy-me. In this sense the connection build between individuals are forced into a specific category themselves, free and productive connections (remember the examples like Mulder and Scully in x files, Buffy and Angel in …) without definition lose their productivity once they become the societally defined category (for example love). 

Also in terms of the capital, imagine the cases where the problem is too much capitalism but the solution offered is even more capitalism, and there is an absence of a real alternative political model, that's why D&G suggest to reject both problem and *the solution* [see @buchanan2008e, 80-28].

#### Ressentiment
Here comes the concept of *ressentiment* by Nietzsche. Think about the unions trying to get a better deal for the workers and the Right's opposition to it. Virtuous selfishness of individual employment contracts are celebrated by the Right. The ressentiment in this case is the triumph of the weak *as weak* is mobilised by the strong against the weak where the interest is hiding behind. The ressentiment then is the coding of the flow of the revolutionary impulse so that appears *self discrediting*. 

==What a schizophrenic reading should be able to do then is to not lose itself in the *ressentiment*, and apply a dialectical reversal and see if this rivalry from the motivation of the same substance ramified on the same body without organs. In the example of Jim vs. Brown, the motivation is to submerge the knowledge and structural transformation of the daily life by the agents of capitalism on a body without organs called *honour* [see @buchanan2008e, 85].==

### **The illegitimate synthesis of conjunction**

> [!quote] 
> Oedipus [i.e., the 'one' with whom we make our 'us'] depends on  this sort of nationalistic, religious, racist sentiment, and not the  reverse: it is not the father who is projected onto the boss, but the  boss who is applied to the father, either in order to tell us 'you will  not surpass your father', or 'you will repress him to find our forefathers'. (AO, 114/123) [ @buchanan2008e, 86]

Oedipus is everywhere because it serves a useful purpose. If the army is daddy because *the power* found out it is a efficient way of obtaining docility [see @buchanan2008e, 87]

The revolutionary pole of group fantasy becomes visible, on the  contrary, in the power to experience institutions themselves as  mortal, to destroy them or change them according to the articulations of desire and the socialfield,by making the death instinct  into a veritable institutional creativity. For that is precisely the  criterion - at least the formal criterion - that distinguishes the revolutionary institution from the enormous inertia which the law communicates to institutions in an established order. As Nietzsche says; churches, armies, States - which of all these dogs wants to die? (AO, 70-1/74)  Is this not what all the colonial writers - from Kipling to Conrad to Forster - feared most? That the empire and all its institutions might prove to be not merely mortal, but sadly all too human as well? Is this not the 'white man's burden', the constant need to prop up the fantasy if not the actual reality of the immortal empire? Was this not 'the horror, the horror' of Kurtz's dying breath? And can we not see Forster's emblematic exhortation 'only connect' as the desperate plea of an individual fantasy that desires nothing so much as to be properly plugged into a group fantasy, something able to confer the feeling of immortality and relieve the ego of its anxiety. Group fantasy incorporates into itself the various syntheses of disjunction which cause our lives to be led in an exclusive and restrictive manner, 'in the sense that each subject, discharged of his personal identity but not of his singularities, enters into relations with others following the communication proper to partial objects [synthesis of connection]: everyone passes into the body of the other on the body without organs' (AO, 71/74).

## The Unconscious
The unconscious is a mythical space where psychoanalysis tries to explain all of the desiring-production and break-flows on, by design it is a lower dimensional representation of higher dimensional elements [@deleuze1983, 61].

## A revolutionary institution?

As all the agents of production and anti-production are reduced to the familial reproduction form Oedipus complex inscribing them to, we discover why libido doesn't even try to leave Oedipus and internalises it. It is not the Oedipus forming the social organisation, it is form of social production imposed on the molecular institution called family. Psychoanalysis is a process of legitimation in this whole layered operation by bringing farcical justifications as a bourgeois medicine: the feigned exclusion of a third party, and the hypocritical role of money. [see @deleuze1983, 64]. [[Schizo]] is exactly because of this reason a problem for the psychoanalysis, he is not oedipiseable because he is not representable in this "space", he is beyond territoriality and brought all his overloading flows with him [see @deleuze1983, 67]. Flows that break the banks of the triangle. Oedipalisation is our internalisation of a form of production and the social relations around/inside/beside it.

## Schizo as a process
Schizophrenia as a process is desiringprodu~tlOn, but I~ ISthis production as it functions at the end, as the limit of SOCial production determined by the conditions of capitalism. It is our very own ".malad~," modern man's sickness.

He has crossed over the limit, the schiz, which maintained the production of desire always at the margins of social production, tangential and always repelled.

even when he is displacing himself in space, his is a journey in intensity, around the desiring-machine that is erected here and remains here. For here is the desert propagated by our world, and also the new earth, and the machine that hums, around which the schizos revolve, planets for a new sun.

They will see that what we call 'schizophrenia' was one of the forms in which, often through quite ordinary people, the light began to break through the cracks in our all-too-closed minds Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be breakthrough The person going through ego-loss or transcendental experiences mayor may not become in different ways confused.

Yet it has been a long time since Engels demonstrated, already apropos of Balzac, how an author is great because he cannot preve~t himself from tracing flows and causing them to circulate, flows that split asunder the catholic and despotic signifier of his work, and that necessarily nourish a revolutionary machine on the horizon. That is what style is, or rather the absence of style-asyntactic, agrammatical: the moment when language is no longer defined by what it says, even less by what makes it a signifying thing, but by what causes it to move, to flow, and to explode-desire. For literature is like schizophrenia: a process and not a goal, a production and not an ex~ression.

Artaud is the fulfillment of literature, precisely becaus.e he IS schizophrenic and not because he is not.

Very few accomplish what Laing calls the breakthrough of this schizophrenic wall or limit: "quite ordinary people," nevertheless. But the majority draw near the wall and back away horrified. ~etter to f~lI back under the law of the signifier, marked by castration, tnangulated In Oedipus. So they displace the limit, they make it pass into the interio~ of the social formation, between the social production and reproduction that they invest, and the familial reproduction that they ~all bac~ on, to which they apply all the investments.
