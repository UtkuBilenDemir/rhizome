<mark class="hltr-gray">> [!Summary] Summary of the whole book
> > The Marx-Freud parallelism between the two remains utterly sterile and insignificant as long as it is expressed in terms that make them introjections or projections of each other without ceasing to be utterly alien to each other, as in the famous equation money = shit. The truth of the matter is that social production is purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions. We maintain that the social field is immediately invested by desire, that it is the historically determined product of desire, and that libido has no need of any mediation or sublimation, any psychic operation, any transformation, in order to invade and invest the productive forces and the relations of production. ***There is only desire and the social, and nothing else*** [@deleuze1983, p. 28-29].</mark>

> [!NOTE] MA
><mark class="hltr-gray"> As Buchanan notes about Lenz. It is how he sees everything in nature; rocks, metals, water, and plants in a process of production [see @buchanan2008e, p. 41]. Similarly, the core of a GenAI is a purely productive look at the nature.</mark>

> The principal goal of Anti-Oedipus is to achieve a theoretical rapprochement between psychoanalysis and Marxism for a new method of critical analysis \[…\] To achieve this goal, it had to do two things:
>
> 1. introduce desire into the conceptual mechanism used to understand [[social production and reproduction]], making it part of the very infrastructure of the daily life;
> 2. introduce the notion of production into the concept  of desire,  thus removing the artificial boundary separating the machinations of desire form the realities of history.
[@buchanan2008e, p. 39]

	But what is the reason of the cases like Schreber, Lenz, and Malone? Buchanan notes;

1. to distinguish between schizophrenia as an illness, and schizophrenia as a process;
2. to identify the operative elements of the schizophrenic process (and mapping them against the processes of unconscious);
3. to demonstrate that the schizophrenic process is the basic matrix of the unconscious.

<mark class="hltr-gray">Furthermore, in the case of schizophrenia as an illness, it is not the illness itself that is turning the patients into catatonic zombies, it is the treatment. The schizophrenic core is productive, and it is machinic for it couldn't take the forms it does if it wasn't [see @buchanan2008e, p. 39]. What the schizophrenic delirium reveals to the individual is the nature as a *process of production*.</mark>

> <mark class="hltr-gray">D&G doesn't say schizophrenia is everywhere; rather what they say is that desiring-production is everywhere, but it is only visible to us in its raw state in schizophrenic delirium. Desiring production is their neologism for a conception of desire infused with production - the first of their two strategic goals. [@buchanan2008e, p. 43]</mark>

> [!quote] 
> Desiring-production is that aspect of the operation of the unconscious that cannot be **assimilated** by what they refer to as social production, and reproduction, or more simply as the **socius**. \[…\] desiring-production is that aspect of desire that the body without organs (BwO) as the agent of anti-production is unable to contain, unable to force onto its smooth surface and thereby repress it (BwO is in fact defined by D&G as the site of primary repression). [@buchanan2008e, p. 44]

> [!u] 
> Can it be that the LLMs reproduce a hegemonic representation as a smooth surface of BwO. And there is a schizophrenic core underneath?

<mark class="hltr-gray">D&G is setting aside the definition of desire thorugh *lack*. Desire does not need to be stimulated by an exogenous force as a need or want, nor it is in need of sublimination, physic operation, or any transformation, in order to invade and invest the productive forces, it is a stimulus on his own right [^1]. ***Every investment of desire is social; there is only desire and the social, and nothing else.*** [see @buchanan2008e, p. 47]</mark>

<mark class="hltr-gray">Desire's primary role is the production of production, it is abundance. Production of fantasies as claimed by phantasies is merely a secondary function, and in lines with the claim of the association between lack and desire  [see @buchanan2008e, p. 49].</mark>

D&G acknowledge that the schizophrenic itself is  not a model for a revolutionary, as in its full flight, it is bereft of social ties [see @buchanan2008e, p. 50].

**The Real** is the end product of the passive syntheses of desire as the autoproduction of the unconscious [see @buchanan2008e, p. 50].

## Production as Process
==Proposition 1: Every flow of desire is production. *Production of productions, of actions, and of passions; production of recording processes, of distributions, and co-ordinates that serve as reference points; productions of consumptions, of sensual pleasures, of anxieties, and of pain.* Recording and production in the production itself, this is the first proposition of process [see @deleuze1983, p. 4].==

==Proposition 2: Man and nature are not distinct, they are one and the same. Nature as production of man by man. They are the one and same essential reality; the producer-product[see @deleuze1983, p. 4-5].==

==Proposition 3: The process is whether to be pushed into a goal, nor into an endless perpetuation. 
U: It must be productive while not getting cut off?[see @deleuze1983, p. 5]==

## Desire
<mark class="hltr-gray">Desire constantly couples continuous flows and [[partial object]]s that are by nature fragmentary and fragmented. Desire causes the current to flow, itself flows in turn, and breaks the flows [see @deleuze1983, p. 5].  Desire produces flow with the partial objects, becomes itself flow, breaks other flows with other partial objects; both breaks and flows are production; *and doubtless each organ-machine interprets the entire world from the perspective of its own flux* [@deleuze1983, p. 5]. The [[connective synthesis]] through the partial object-flow is product/producing.</mark>

The traditional logic of desire is all wrong. Platonic logic forces us to choose between *acquisition* and *production*, whereas the acquisition immediately implicates the ***lack*** as an idealistic grounding; lack of an object, lack of the real object [see @deleuze1983, p.25] .

Psychoanalysis has an explanation (albeit fantasy related) for desire as a productive force. The lack of the real object immediately implicates is that the lacking object is related to some extrinsic natural or social production, and the desiring-machine is producing an image of that, as a double reality, as a mental production. Hence the fantasy is that of a double world, and the only argument for the lack is that the double is lacking some specific thing the real world contains [see @deleuze1983, p.25]. Rather, desire is a machine, and the object of desire another machine connected to it. Hence the product is something removed or deducted from the process of producing. Desire is not bolstered by needs, needs are derived from desire, they are counterproducts within the real that desire produces [@deleuze1983, p.27].

Why is the concept of lack problematic? Because the lack propagates itself in accordance with the organisation of an already existing organisation of production [@deleuze1983, p.28]. Lack is created deliberately as a necessary function of the market economy. This includes the deliberate organisation of the wants and needs amidst the abundance in production.

There are rather 3 errors concerning the desire; [[lack]], [[law]], and [[signifier]]. The introduction of lack reduces the desiring production into a mere production of fantasies. [@deleuze1983, p.111]

## Desiring-Production
The product is an off-shoot of the production itself, and at the same time the parts of the machine are the fuel that make it run. Art often capitalises on this property and short-circuits social production via the desiring-production. Explosion of a desiring-machine in an object of the social production is a common theme in art, desiring machines undermine technical machines [see @deleuze1983, p.31]. 

## [[Body Without Organs]] (BwO)
BwO is an anti-productive force that couples with the process and opposes desiring-production. It *falls back on* all production forming surface which the forces and agents of production are distributed, thereby appropriating for itself all surplus production and arrogating to itself both the whole and the parts of the process, which now seem to emanate from it as a quasi cause [@deleuze1983, p. 10]. 

Capital is the BwO of capitalist or of the capitalist being. Machines and agents of production seem to be *miraculated* by it, they cling to it closely, they orbit around its gravitational pull. Everything seems like as if it was immediately produced by the capital. At the beginning the relation between the productive forces and capital, the opposition between the labor forces and capital are apparent, as well as, the use of capital to extort surplus value. But as the capital plays the role of the *recording surface* of production (recording surface because the very production itself is defined by its terms), it *falls back on* all production, becomes a mystic being since all labour's social productive forces appear to be due to capital, rather than labour itself as the core of production, and seem to issue from the very womb of the Capital itself; thus the fetish is established [see @deleuze1983, p. 10].

The BwO now falls back on (se rabat sur) desiring production, attracts it, and appropriates it for its own [@deleuze1983, p. 11]. The desiring-machines, the organ-machines cling on to the BwO through a gravitational pull that defines the whole production now, by steering the flows, by being an attraction-machine. Although, the attraction-machine turns itself a coexistence of a paranoiac-machine and miraculating-machine, it denies there was anything paradoxical with this mechanism in the first place. The whole desiring-production is inscribed on it albeit its unconsumable, unproductive nature, it becomes the very surface of the flows. Capital is the dead labor, yet the productive labor is defined, measured, attracted by it, and exists on its surface, getting inscribed on its surface, it acts like a quasi cause for all production with its fetish character.

BwO is not god, but the energy sweeps through it is divine, when it attracts to itself the entire process of production and serves as a miraculating enchanted surface, inscribing each and every one of its disjunctions [@deleuze1983, p.13] .

## Passive Syntheses
D&G give rise to the basic concept of the desiring-machines as well as the means of establishing an effective connection between psychoanalysis and Marxism, or more particularly individual desire and social control.

Passive synthesis happens in the mind but not carried our by the mind. This production binds itself with the question "how desire work?"; effectively this is the same question as "how does the unconscious come into being?". D&G put *the habit* into the centre of it; and the passive synthesis is through the habit as it is elementary part is not just a process to receive sensation (as Kant would argue for) but a synthetic ability to constitute *the sensate organism* as well. Thus the [[habit (constituent passivity)]] is constituted by two forces; [[organic synthesis]] and [[perceptual synthesis]]. This definition of habit refers to its pre-subjective form, and not the ones we can define as something *I do*. On this level *the contraction* and through that *the contemplation* is not an activity of a *self*. The self is not an integrated whole, it is rather a collection of *little selves* contemplate and render possible the *active self* [^2]. Selves are larval subjects [^3], there is a self wherever a furtive contemplation (an instance?) is achieved [see @buchanan2008e, p. 53-54]. 

- **Connective Synthesis**: Mobilises the Libido as withdrawal energy
- **Disjunctive Synthesis**: Mobilises the Numen as detachment energy
- **Conjunctive Synthesis**: Mobilises Voluptas as residual energy

These all three are grounded by Marx' surplus formula as

$$
MCM'
$$

> [!u]
> Can we say that the whole productive process is getting poured into the capital over time? Not just on an individual level but also as the history of capitalism. Material expansion is getting turned into a financial expansion over time.

Money capital sets production into motion, only to lead to the capital growth. 

All three syntheses correspond to Marx' formula

### Connective Synthesis (Primitive Accumulation, Production of Production)
"Free Labour" or "Primitive accumulation" phase that sets everything in motion [@buchanan2008e, p. 55]

The synthesis of connection snaps our organs together in a new arrangement of its own making and its own design [@buchanan2008e, p. 59].

The essential point is that the primitive accumulation gives rise to something bigger than itself [@buchanan2008e, p. 55]. 

### Disjunctive Synthesis (Separation Phase)

1. **A distribution in relation to the non-productive element (BwO)** [@deleuze1983, p.12]
2. **Overlaps the connective synthesis** [@deleuze1983, p.13]: Libido is the connective force but parts of it is also determining the disjunctive inscription (Numen).
Correspond to the intermediary phase of investment in industry (input-output combinations) [@buchanan2008e, p. 55]

Operates on the platform created by the primitive accumulation ([[#Connective Synthesis (Primitive Accumulation, Production of Production)]]), namely [[Body Without Organs]]  [@buchanan2008e, p. 59].

The primitive accumulation not only creates something greater of itself but also, but something that ultimately triumphs over it, capital consumes the productive power of its workers and represents itself back to them as its own power [see @buchanan2008e, p. 60].

> [!u] 
> Isn't it basically what models do to us? Taking all the humanity's creative production and not only selling it back to ourselves, but also presenting it as a monolithic truth?

The power of capital is a fetish produced by the connected labour, but presents itself as something  other, a self sustaining entitiy to repress its very producers. Produced by the workers socially, only to tower over them as an ever existing oppressor. It indeed looks like a power which capital possesses by its nature, a productive power inherent in capital [see @buchanan2008e, p. 60]. The true ideological power of the capital is that it portrays itself, and not the sweat of labour that enabled to come into being in the first place, as the real enabling force in contemporary society [@buchanan2008e, p. 62].

<mark class="hltr-red">the BwO is simply not capital, but the acceptance of it as a model of right in Hegel's sense [@buchanan2008e, p. 62].
</mark>

Disjunctive synthesis is the recording phase, it is distribution and inscription instead of combination and production in opposition to the connective synthesis.
#### [[Interpellation]] (AltHUSSER)
**BwO** is standing there instead of ideology. If it functions as ideology, is a subject for research, however, it replaces to underlying fabric which we call an ideology and it teaches us how to **reproduce the relations of production** [see @buchanan2008e, p. 61]. Instead of allocating the subjectivity creation to the ideological state apparatuses, we have BwO forging them in its gravitational pull.

### Conjunctive Synthesis
The production of consumption [@deleuze1983, p.18/23]

This is the third phase in which money capital is set free all over again [@buchanan2008e, p. 55].

It is that reward falls onto us after the previous stages [@buchanan2008e, p. 63]. 

## Celibate Machine
It seems like the celibate machine is the one that severes itself from the pull of the BwO. It does this at the stage of the conjunctive synthesis by recoding the consummation itself.

A genuine consummation is achieved by the new machine, it is constantly producing novelty, its behaviour cannot be explained just by the miraculating effect. A new birth, a radiant ecstacy. What does it produce though? Intensive quantities [see @deleuze1983, p.18].

## u: Identity as [[Instance]]

Subject is produced as a residuum to the conjunctive synthesis. Yet it is not a fixed identity that is being processed one way or another. It is an instance appears bound to the circlings around the centrifugal force . The individual is seeking their centre incapable of realising what circles they area subject to. The oscillations of the orbital movements define in one instance this subjectivity, yet it is not the only one. Subject is going through a series of states. In the centre the desiring-machine is celibate, yet the residual subject garnering process receives a reward (Voluptas, conjunctive synthesis).
[@deleuze1983, p.21]. Through the history, through the circles, through the residuals, they are saying "They are me, it is me".

## Schizo
The product doesn't give any clues about its production. The topic is to replace the idealistic analyses with the material process of production. 

## Fascism
> after centuries of exploitation, why do people still tolerate being humiliated and enslaved, to such a point, indeed, that they actually want humiliation and slavery not only for others but for themselves? Reich is at his profoundest as a thinker when he refuses to accept ignorance or illusion on the part of the masses as an explanation of fascism, and demands an explanation that will take their desires into account, an explanation formulated in terms of desire: no, the masses were not innocent dupes; at a certain point, under a certain set of conditions, they wanted fascism, and it is this perversion of the desire of the masses that needs to be accounted for [@deleuze1983, p.29].

The missing link understanding the psychological effects of the fascism was the desiring production as the force producing the real both in so-called rational and irrational forms. Desiring production is the one and the same thing as social production. 

## Territorial, despotic, capitalist machines
The [[despotic machine]] tried to handle the shortcomings of the primitive [[territorial machine]] by overcoding the socius. But the [[capitalist machine]] in the ruins of the despotic machine is mainly decoding and deterritorialising the flows. It is born through the encounter of two flows; the decoded flows of production and the decoded flows of labour in the form of the "free worker". **Unlike the other ones, the capitalist machine does/can not provide a code that will apply to the whole socius**. [see @deleuze1983, p.33].

Money becomes the code itself under capitalist machine.

Schizophrenia is the product of the deterritorialisation under the capitalist machine, as manic depression and paranoia of the despotic machine, and hysteria of the territorial machine.

Capitalism is constantly reaching a limit while at the same time seeking to avoid that limit (maybe also trying to expand that limit?). The decoding/deterritorialising flows on the one side, and violent reterritorialisation on the other. State, nation, families, they reoccur, return, recur endlessly. As in Marx' formulation there is the diminishing profit while increment in the absolute value of the surplus value [see @deleuze1983, p.34].

> The more the capitalist machine deterritorializes, decoding and axiomatizing flows in order to extract surplus value from them, the more its ancillary apparatuses, such as government bureaucracies and the forces of law and order, do their utmost to reterritorialize, absorbing in the process a larger and larger share of surplus value [see @deleuze1983, p.35]. 

U: *decomposition* seems to be a fitting term. 

The productive conntections on the BwO resemble a **Markov Chain** [see @deleuze1983, p.39]

## 2 Characteristics of a Machine
- *Coupres-prelevements*: Breaks in terms of breaking the flows (slicing off)
- *Coupres-detachments*: Breaks in terms of separating machines, signs
- *Coupure-reste*: The subject is formed in residuum

Associative flux -> the reproduction of the process of detachment from the signifying chain -> residuum that constitutes the share of the subject from the whole

## The Whole
The whole itself is a product, produced simply as another part alongside other parts, it neither unifies or totalises, though it has an effect on the parts by establishing connections, paths of communication between them [see @deleuze1983, p.43].
The BwO is produced in the same way as a whole but in its own particular place in the process of production alongside other parts. It neither unifies or totalises.

> And when it [BwO] operates on them, when it turns back upon them (se rabat sur elles), it brings about transverse communications, transfinite summarizations, polyvocal and transcursive inscriptions on its own surface, on which the functional breaks of partial objects are continually intersected by breaks in the signifying chains, and by breaks effected by a subject that uses them as reference points in order to locate itself. [see @deleuze1983, p.43]

The artist is the master of objects, he is creating machines, desiring machines that dismantle the technical machines, his very task is the explosion of the technical machines. Technical machines not a cause but merely an index of the social production, it is created in a specific context and purpose in the socius. However, the desiring-machines are a fundamental category of the economy of desire, they produce a BwO just by their copulating process [see @deleuze1983, p. 32] . 

Social production is primarily driven by the desiring-production, *homo natura* comes first in this sense. But the desiring-production is social before everything else, frees itself only at the end. That indicates that *Homo Historia* comes first. The BwO doesn't apply itself to the socius in the later stages, it is tasked with codifying the flows of the desire, channeling, regulating [see @deleuze1983, p.33] .

The unconscious is subject to the same laws -> connective synthesis or "production of production" starts with coupling the libidinal flows with partial objects that interrupt flows, create new ones ->
