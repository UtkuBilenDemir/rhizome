# Chapter_3

There is social production from the moment there is social production and reproduction. But in a precise manner, it is true that the pre capitalist regimes are inherent in desire: they code it, they code the flows of desire. Capitalism is the only one focusing on decoding the flows, therefore, it liberates the flows of desire, but under the social conditions that define its limit and the possiblity of its own dissolution, so that is constantly opposing with all its exasperated strength the movement that drives it towarsds its limit [@deleuze1983, 140]

> [!quote] 
> Hence the goal of schizoanalysis: to analyze the specific nature of the libidinal investments in the economic and political spheres, and thereby to show how, in the subject who desires, desire can be made to desire its own repression—whence the role of the death instinct in the circuit connecting desire to the social sphere. All this happens, not in ideology, but well beneath it. An unconscious investment of a fascist or reactionary type can exist alongside a conscious revolutionary investment.[@deleuze1983, 105]

Political, economic, religious are the fields of libidinal investments, they are not derivatives of an oedipal structure.

There are 3 regimes, the primitive [[territorial machine]], the [[despotic machine]], and the modern [[capitalist machine]]. Analysing the history of the social machine leads to the defining the process leading to capitalism, and building a genealogy for the contemporary.

? Symbolic as the domain of latency, and the imaginary as the realisation of the desire's trajectory.

## The Ontology of Social Machines
> Social machines are statistically constituted and follow a law of  large numbers (AO, 316/342). What do Deleuze and Guattari mean  by this? It is a code phrase implying that the social formation is  brought into being by the accumulation or aggregation of desiringmachines, but the net result of this process cannot be understood in  linear terms. [@buchanan2008e, 90]

==> The whole is greater than its parts

> Essentially what Deleuze and Guattari are arguing  here is this: the movement of microscopic entities combines to  produce macroscopic entities which in turn react on those same  microscopic entities, forcing them to adapt and change. As a simple  example of this, one can look at the notions of the crowd, herd or  swarm: all three are composed of x number of individual beings who  by themselves act quite differently to how they act in a group. To put  it another way, the behaviour of the individual components of these  three forms taken on their own is not a reliable indicator of the  behaviour of the crowd, herd or swarm. As is well known perfectly  docile men and women can behave with extraordinary courage or  equally extraordinary violence once swept up in a crowd.[@buchanan2008e, 91]

==Social formations come into being and endure by capturing and coding the flows of desire.==

### Primitive, despotic, capitalistic
Was capitalism always a threat lingering in the background in the history of humankind? And are all the social machines before were trying to keep this threat at bay? So the other regimes are the negation of negations?

D&G's hypothesis have 3 components:
1. **Desire is actually gregarious (sociable, collectivable) in nature**: If it wasn't this way, it wouldn't be possible for people to fight for their own oppression.
2. **Desire is not bonding**: It can bring a group together but it won't make them *endure*  Man is in a way both homo natura and homo historia. **Desire needs to be trained or disciplined to produce lasting collectivities**. This is the reason why all the social formations before capitalism saw the flows of desire as dangerous and *coded* it.
3. **Desire is socialised by codification**: *==Women, children, herds, seed, sperm, shit, menstrual blood and so on are  transformed into gifts from God, or given some other symbolic  value and thereby given a social function they did not previously  have. \[…\]What we have to decipher is the social purpose behind the  encoding of every aspect of daily life from the most mundane and  the sheerly biological to the complex and metaphysical.==* [@buchanan2008e, 94]

> The earth is the body without organs on a social scale - it is in effect  the body without organs of all the bodies without organs of all the  individual subjects in any given society. Communities are formed in  the same way as subjects: an aggregate of syntheses gives rise to a  'whole' that acts retroactively on the syntheses to yield an entity  qualitatively different from its component parts. That entity is then  enjoyed or consumed for itself. Deleuze and Guattari's thesis is that  communities can be formed in this way because subjects are formed  in this way. By the same token, subjects can be formed in this way  because communities are. This is what is meant by their thesis that  desire forms part of the infrastructure of society. [@buchanan2008e, 95]

The formation of a subject and the social is obliging to same mechanics.

Desiring-production is also the limit of social production, it is what social production reverts to if its structures and mechanisms fail (a rebuilding process, a revolution; they all depend on the desiring-production at the end). ==> social production is molar, desiring-production is molecular, the difference is in function, not scale.

? Both the earth and the BwO should be understood as agents of repression?[@buchanan2008e, 96]

## The Territorial Machine
Two paradigmatic assumptions of Anthropology:
1. Incest taboo is universal and proscribes a *real desire*. -> **Counterargument**: Society captivates desire by by luring it into feeling guilty.

	**On the prohibition of incest**: a somatic sytem can only sustain itslef as the filiations get extended, and the lateral alliances being established. Prohibition of the incest with the sister is guaranteeing the lateral alliance; and with the mother the filiation extension is secured. [see @deleuze1983, 159]
	 
2. All relations between the subjects are the relations of exchange. -> **Counterargument**: Society is inscriptive, not exchangist

Territorial machines by capturing desire and channeling into a different function. There isn't a single or universal machine but rather affinity or co-efficiency between different social machines and desiring machines. The medium these work through is **representation**, which takes hold on and represses the [[germinal influx]] that's desire's representative.

The socius desire is not yet trapped in the territorial machine, the flows are roaming freely and the simple represented in representation has not yet taken the role of the representative [@deleuze1983, 185].

Three parts of Oedipus' inscription on desire:
1. Germinal influx as the representative of desire
2. The prohibition against this representative (repressing representation)
3. While the figure of the transgressor is the displaced representative

==**A good example:** Prohibition of sex before marriage;==
- The prohibition depicts sex outside the marriage as deletorious to the well-being of the individual and society itself.
- And promote cavalier attitude etc. 
- But it is only the prohibition itself that creates the "sex before marriage"
- So, the concept is created to be shamed by the same authority. (islam?)
- It is a displacement of real desire.
- It is coding the desire and respecting the order turns into a prestige in the community. ==> **Libido** turned into **Numen** and then into **Voluptas**

**Affiliation** and **Alliance** are the 2 kind of relationships between people in groups. [@buchanan2008e, 99]

> Society is not exchangist, the socius is inscriptive: not exchanging but marking bodies, which are part of the earth. We have seen that the regime of debt directly resulted from this savage inscription. For debt is the unit of alliance, and alliance is representation itself. It is alliance that codes the flows of desire and that, by means of debt, creates for man a memory of words (paroles). It is alliance that represses the great, intense, mute filiative memory, the germinal influx as the representative of the noncoded flows of desire capable of submerging everything. It is debt that articulates the alliances with the filiations that have become extended, in order to form and to forge a system in extension (representation) based on the repression of nocturnal intensities. The alliance-debt answers to what Nietzsche described as humanity's prehistoric labor: the use of the cruelist mnemotechnics, in naked flesh, to impose a memory of words founded on the ancient biocosmic memory. That is why it is so important to see debt as a direct consequence of the primitive inscription process, instead of making it—and the inscriptions themselves—into an indirect means of universal exchange.
> [@deleuze1983, 185]

A chief is a chief because of a chain of **affiliations** (fixed capital), but he cannot reign without forming **alliances**. So he turns his wealth (perishables) into respect, *debt*, and other non-perishables to in the context of alliances. [@buchanan2008e, 100]

==> Primitive surplus value is the **Surplus Value of Code** [@deleuze1983, 150]

U: A similar thing can be said about the relationship with some gods. We sacrifice valuable wealth for them to trigger the same mechanism in an abstract way.

Even having tribal symbols on skin plays into this *indebtedness*.

According to D&G, it is not an exchange though. The chief doesn't exchange his wealth with alliance, he converts his wealth into allainace [@buchanan2008e, 101]

Three things a primitive inscription requires:
- A voice that speak (Alliance)
- A sign marked in bare flesh (Affiliation)
- An eye that extracts enjoyment from the pain (declension of the two)

### AO
There is a representative of desire, it is a representative becuase it is equivalent to the noncodable, decoded flows -> repression of the representative

repressed representative , repressing representation, displaced represented

There is no possiblity to reduce the social relations onto the family completely. Even in the family and in infancy all the relations are social investments.

Oedipus is colonial, the colonised natives, their connections, their flows will be recoded in a machinery called family through the oedipal structure. Also for us, the Oedipus is an interior colony, it is our intimate colonial education.

**Oedipal representation as an object of repression**: 
- Incest is desired because it is prohibited
- The prohibition of incest implies an oedipal representation
- And it would be born of repression of this representation and of the latter's return
- **Now the opposite is the case**: Oedipal representation presupposes the prohibition of incest, not even possible to say that the representation was born out of the prohibition.

Oedipus is not the truth of the unconscious, it is a mystification of the unconscious that only succeeded with us by assembling the parts and wheels of the previous social formations. 

### Territorial representation
While the representation is always a repression of the desiring-production, it has diverse ways according the social formation (remember the repressed representative, repressing representation and the displaced represented) [see @deleuze1983, 184].

In the primitive socius, desire is not yet trapped and the flows haven't yet their polivocity and simple represented in representation has not yet taken the place of the representative. 

#### The role of DEBT

> [!quote] 
> Society is not exchangist, the socius is inscriptive: not exchanging but marking bodies, which are part of the earth. We have seen that the regime of debt directly resulted from this savage inscription. For debt is the unit of alliance, and alliance is representation itself. It is alliance that codes the flows of desire and that, by means of debt, creates for man a memory of words (paroles). It is alliance that represses the great, intense, mute filiative memory, the germinal influx as the representative of the noncoded flows of desire capable of submerging everything. It is debt that articulates the alliances with the filiations that have become extended, in order to form and to forge a system in extension (representation) based on the repression of nocturnal intensities. The alliance-debt answers to what Nietzsche described as humanity's prehistoric labor: the use of the cruelist mnemotechnics, in naked flesh, to impose a memory of words founded on the ancient biocosmic memory. That is why it is so important to see debt as a direct consequence of the primitive inscription process, instead of making it—and the inscriptions themselves—into an indirect means of universal exchange.
> [@deleuze1983, 185]

The alliances articulated by debt, the prehistoric labour. Not exchange, inscription.

#### Subordination to the Vocal

> [!quote] 
> Savage formations are oral, are vocal, but not because they lack a graphic system: a dance on the earth, a drawing on a wall, a mark on the body are a graphic system, a geo-graphism, a geography. These formations are oral precisely because they possess a graphic system that is independent of the voice, a system that is not aligned on the voice and not subordinate to it, but connected to it, coordinated "in an organization that is radiating, as it were," and multidimensional. (And it must be said that this graphic system is linear writing's contrary: civilizations cease being oral only through losing the independence and the particular dimensions of the graphic system; by aligning itself on the voice, graphism supplants the voice and induces a fictitious voice.) Andre Leroi-Gourhan has admirably described these two heterogeneous poles of the savage inscription process or territorial representation: the couple voice-audition and hand-graphics.34 How does such a machine work? For it does work: the voice is like a voice of alliance to which, on the side of the extended filiation, a graphics is coordinated that bears no resemblance. [@deleuze1983, 188]

The debt is the element to inscribe a new memory of history in human mind, alliances, expanded affiliations, coding the flows of desire in socius; debt, open, mobile, and finite (yet). Debt is not to be paid back, we are not looking for a good debtor, the contrary, the bad debtor is the agent of this network.

But how does one pay for the debt with suffering (a thief paying for his crime with bodily harm). We need the audience for that, an eye that extracts pleasure from the "event", this has nothing to do with vengeance. THis is the step stone for the [[Chapter_3#The Despotic Machine]]; coding pain and death, delimited and coordinated flows, everything is assigned a meaning in relation to the whole; the despot is the ultimate organiser. The despotic machine takes over in expense of tremendous amount of freedom, like an artist's arrogance.

> A concerted destruction of all the primitive codings, or worse yet, their derisory preservation, their reduction to the condition of secondary parts in the new machine, and the new apparatus of repression (refoulement). All that constituted the essential element of the primitive inscription machine—the blocks of mobile, open, finite debts, "the parcels of destiny"—finds itself taken into an immense machinery that renders the debt infinite and no longer forms anything but one and the same crushing fate: "the aim now is to preclude pessimistically, once and for all, the prospect of a final discharge; the aim now is to make the glance recoil disconsolately from an iron impossibility."41 The earth becomes a madhouse. [@deleuze1983, 192]

<mark class="hltr-magenta">Note to MA:</mark> Generative AI is the subordination to a specific type of vocal, or is it a specific type of inscription.

## The Despotic Machine
==A new alliance, and direct filiation==
The despot imposes a new alliance system and places himself in direct filiation with the deity, the people must follow. The despot is a paranoiac.

> [!quote] 
> But we always rediscover the figures of this paranoiac and his perverts, the conqueror and his elite troops, the despot and his bureaucrats, the holy man and his disciples, the anchorite and his monks, Christ and his Saint Paul. Moses flees from the Egyptian machine into the wilderness and installs his new machine there, a holy ark and a portable temple, and gives his people a new religious-military organization. In order to summarize Saint John the Baptist's enterprise, one author declares: "John attacks at its foundation the central doctrine of Judaeism, the doctrine of the alliance with God through a filiation that goes back to Abraham." [@deleuze1983, 193]

The whole relative play of alliances and filiations is carried to an absolute im the new allinace and this specifc direct affiliation. The full body of the earth has bee replaced with the body of the despot himself or his god. From cultivating (tilling) the earth to cultivating the god, the ideology, the doctrin.
 
The basic components of the despotic machine were always present in the primitive machine. The territorial machine knew about the despotic machine all along. *The State* became into being fully formed in that sense [@buchanan2008e, 102]. And the wheels of the territorial machine subsist in the despotic machine, but they are nothing but the working parts of the State machine now [see @deleuze1983, 196]. The coded flows of the territorial machine are overcoded.

??the despotic state only knows a virtual existence??

### Dialectics
Contrary to the Marx' reformulation of Hegel's dialectical understanding both the *money* (Marx mentions this point already) and the *State* are entities gained their existince from being abstract to concrete. 

The State was at first the abstract idea and some organisation form functioning separately . In those terms the despotic machine has never actually existed and our capitalist being is not a good tool to grasp despotic machinery. It is an osciallating machine between the primitice territorial machine and the modern capitalist machine, a vanishing mediator if you like. [see @buchanan2008e, 103-104]

### Machinery of the despotic machine
A new alliance and direct filiation.

The despot challenges the lateral alliances and the extended filiations of the old community. He imposes a new alliance system and places himself in the direct filiation with the deity; people must follow [@buchanan2008e, 105]. The despot can be recognised by his willingness to start from zero, to scratch out everythng that had gone before and begin again from a blank slate (a revolutionary is a despot himself? Marx refers to Jacobins as ones at the end). Moses, Saint-Paul, Jesus, all are despots in this definition, no?

> [!quote] 
> The despot, or his God, becomes the full  body on which the socius inscribes itself, replacing the territorial  machine's earth. However, what counts is not the person of the new  sovereign, nor indeed his psychology, but the nature of the new  regime this change inaugurates: the 'megamachine' of the state  replaces the territorial machine, a new hierarchy is installed, placing  the despot at the top and the villagers at the bottom, bureaucracy  replaces intertribal alliance, and most importantly of all stock  becomes the object of accumulation and correspondingly debt is  rendered infinite in the form of tribute to the despot (AO, 212/230).  'What is suppressed is not the former regime of lateral alliances and  extended filiations, but merely their determining character.' (AO,  213/231). The territorial machine's components continue to exist,  but only as the cogs and wheels of the despotic machine that has  overtaken them from within and without. The new regime overcodes  all the previous codings of desire and in this way extracts its requisite share of surplus value. [@buchanan2008e, 105]

How is the money decisive in this machinery? Flows of money as in decoded flows feared by the depotic machine similarly to the territorial machine. But the money is an invention of state primarily to make the debt through taxation **infinite**. The debt becomes the debt of existence, repaying is a duty but lending is optional.

With the despotic machine, we no longer need the mark of the socius to show commitment to it , writing can do nothing but bear witness to vanished despot.

2 Aspects of the state:
- It internalises a field of increasingly decoded social force (physical system)
- it spiritualises a supraterrestial field which it overcodes (metaphysical system)

> Translated, this means  the state unleashes market forces (i.e., decodedflows),that exceed its  grasp in all directions, its ability to overcode in other words, and this  process eventually leads to an inversion of the relation between the  sovereign and the system he heads. At the supreme point of the  development of this process of inversion, the state is transformed  into a mechanism of business. But even as its real power diminishes,  the state reinvents itself as a 'moral authority'. Thus, as Deleuze and  Guattari frequently say, what the state deterritorializes with one  hand it reterritorializes with the other. It provides the moral glue  that unites the axiomatic of capital with the assemblage of the  people. [@buchanan2008e, 107]

#### The State
- commences (or recommences) act of territoriality through the fixing of residence
- act of liberation through the abolition of small debts.

From a perspective, there is no change when State no longer does anything than guarantee the provate property of a ruling class that becomes distinct from the State. Abolition of debts is a mean to maintaining the distribution of land and a means of prevnting the entry on stage of a new territorial machine, possibly revolutionary and more capable. As the territorial machine, the State is threatened by the decoded flows; flows of production, and also mercantile flows that might escape the state monopoly; the State prevents them by tight restrictions. Why capitalism wasn't born in china in 13. century although the conditions were established? Because the State closed the mines as soon as the reserves of metal were judged sufficient [@deleuze1983, 197]

#### Money
The despotic State's relationship with money is synthetic, not analytical. The despotic tie between the State's sustain, between money and tas is ever so prominent even after the dominant classes set themselves apart from the apparatus. The heavy taxes are good for business, the circulation of money renders the debts infinite.

Then
1. The State subordinates all the primitive filiations to the despotic machine through deterritorialisation
2. The abolition of debts and their transformation initiates a duty of an interminable service to the State and subordinate all the primitive alliances.

==Repaying is a duty, lending is optional==

The despotic State
1. replaces territorial machine
2. maintains old territorialities to subordinate them as organs

#### Writing
It is the despot, who establishes the writing, making the symbol a subordinate to the vioce, the imperial formation makes graphism into a system of writing in the proper sense of the term. [see @Deleuze, 202] 

> The primitive territorial sign is self-validating; it is a position of desire in a state of multiple connections. It is not a sign of a sign nor a desire of a desire. It knows nothing of linear subordination and its reciprocity: neither pictogram nor ideogram, it is rhythm and not form, zigzag and not line, artifact and not idea, production and not expression. Let us try to summarize the differences between these two forms of representation, territorial and imperial. [@deleuze1983, 203]

Barbarian (despotic) societies are written because the graphic system has lost its independence and got subordinated to the voice. 

> Then there occurs a crushing of the magic triangle: the voice no longer sings but dictates, decrees; the graphy no longer dances, it ceases to animate bodies, but is set into writing on tablets, stones, and books; the eye sets itself to reading. (Writing does not entail but implies a kind of blindness, a loss of vision and of the ability to appraise; it is now the eye that suffers, although it also acquires other functions.) Or rather, we are unable to say that the magic triangle is completely crushed: it subsists as a base and as a brick, insofar as the territorial machine continues to function in the framework of the new machine.
> [@deleuze1983, 205]

So, the symbols of the primitive machine are never gone, they are repuposed into a despotic indoctrination. Deleuze mentions the example of how Islam in specific regions used the symbolic esoterism of the previous animist values, a good example would be also how turkic shamanist culture was subordinated in Anatolia.

> The sign made letter.  Desire no longer dares to desire, having become a desire of desire, a desire of the despot's desire. The mouth no longer speaks, it drinks the letter. The eye no longer sees, it reads. The body no longer allows itself to be engraved like the earth, but prostrates itself before the engravings of the despot, the region beyond the earth, the new full body.
> [@deleuze1983, 206]

#### Signifier & Authority
Imperial representation can claim to be better than the territorial representation. The flesh itself is not suffering to bear signs, instead the inscription is on stones, tablets, parchments. 

> The eye no longer extracts a surplus value from the spectacle of suffering, it has ceased to evaluate; it has begun rather to "forewarn" and keep watch, to see that no surplus value escapes the overcoding of the despotic machine. For all the organs and their functions experience a detachment and elevation that relates them to, and makes them converge on, the [[full body]] of the despot. In point of fact the regime is not milder; the system of terror has replaced the system of cruelty. The old cruelty persists, especially in the autonomous or quasi-autonomous sectors; but it is now bricked into the State apparatus, which at times organizes it and at other times tolerates or limits it, in order to make it serve the ends of the State, and to subsume it under the higher superimposed unity of a Law that is more terrible.
> [@deleuze1983, 211]

Despot's full body cannot let any organ to sway and grow independent, it has to containt the whole extent of the organic formation. The instruments to contain, limit the movement of the desiring-production is the threat of violence. This is the [[sovereign power]] of Foucault reigning through the power over death. The system of terror replaced the system of cruelty.

#### Law
> the law is the invention of the despot himself: it is the juridical form assumed by the infinite debt. The jurist will be seen in the despot's procession up to the time of the late Roman emperors, and the juridical form will accompany the imperial formation, the legislator alongside the monster, Gaius and Commodus, Papinian and Caracalla, Ulpian and Heliogabalus, "the delirium of the twelve Caesars and the Golden Age of Roman Law"— taking the debtor's side against the creditor when necessary, so as to consolidate the infinite debt.
> [@deleuze1983, 213]

As a consequence of the "vengeance exercised in advance", the passivity becomes the virtue of the subjects attached to the despotic body.

#### The despotic State
It is not that historical break like any other, it is not involved in Marx' 5 Stages; primitive communism, ancient city-states, feudalism, capitalism, socialism. It is a pure abstraction or the origin of abstraction, a regulating idea or principle of reflection(terror) that organises the parts and the flows into a whole (a digitalising machine?). 

As Marx noted that there are two things going from abstract to concrete in the history, money and the state (Deleuze mentions it previously), 

> Marx recognized that there was indeed a way in which history proceeded from the abstract to the concrete: "the simple categories are the expression of relations within which the less developed concrete may have already realized itself before having posited the more many-sided connection or relation which is mentally expressed in the more concrete category; while the more developed concrete preserves the same category as a subordinate relation."63 The State was first this abstract unity that integrated subaggregates functioning separately; it is now subordinated to a field of forces whose flows it co-ordinates and whose autonomous relations of domination and subordination it expresses.
> \[…\] 
> In brief, it does not cease being artificial, but it becomes concrete, it "tends to concretization" while subordinating itself to the dominant forces. The existence of an analogous evolution has been demonstrated for the technical machine, when it ceases to be an abstract unity or intellectual system reigning over separate subaggregates to become a relation that is subordinated to a field of forces operating as a concrete physical system.
> \[…\]
> Again and again we come upon the monstrous paradox; the State is desire that passes from the head of the despot to the hearts of his subjects, and from the intellectual law to the entire physical system that disengages or liberates itself from the law. A State desire, the most fantastic machine for repression, is still desire—the subject that desires and the object of desire. Desire—such is the operation that consists in always stamping the mark of the primordial Urstaat on the new state of things, rendering it immanent to the new system insofar as possible, making it interior to this system.
> [@deleuze1983, 221]

## The (civilized) Capitalist Machine
Deleuze and Guattari are contrasting two modes of social organization: the “despotic” and the “capitalist” machines. The despotic machine is “synchronic,” meaning it operates in a fixed, centralized manner, maintaining a rigid structure. Capitalism, on the other hand, is “diachronic,” evolving over time, breaking from feudalism slowly. This gradual, creative disruption is what they call “schizoid time,” emphasizing capitalism’s continuous transformation and adaptation. 

Capitalism does not break free from the despotic machine, nor the flows decoded by the despotic machine enough to give birth to capitalism.

> Capital is dead labour, […] sucking living labour, and lives the more, more labour it sucks. 

It is not the technique what was missing in 13. Century China, or Moslem ships, it is that the desire was still caught in the nets of the despotic machine there [see @deleuze1983, 224].

That's why capitalism is not only defined by decoded flows, but by the generalised decoding of flows, new massive deterritorialisation, the conjunction of the deterritorialised flows. 

> By simplifying a lot, we can say that the savage territorial machine operated on the basis of connections of production, and that the barbarian despotic machine was based on disjunctions of inscription derived from the eminent unity. But the capitalist machine, the civilized machine, will first establish itself on the conjunction. When this occurs, the conjunction no longer merely designates remnants that have escaped coding, or consummations-consumptions as in the primitive feasts, or even the "maximum consumption" in the extravagance of the despot and his agents.
> [@deleuze1983, 224]

When the conjunction, the commodities, the products of the disjunctive syntheses moves to the fores of the social machine, becomes extensive, pushing to the expanding borders of the social, it makes luxury itself in a form of investment, and **reduces all the decoded flows into production**, in a *production for production's sake* that rediscovers the primitive connections of labor, on condition-- on the sole condition-- that they be linked to capital and to the new deterritorialised full body [@deleuze1983, 225]. In order to free the desire from the despot's full body we need the production for production's sake and product itself as an investment detached from its use.

This leads to the two principal of capitalism, the deterritorialised worker who has become free and (but?) naked, having to sell his labor capacity; and on the other, decoded money that has become capital and is capable of buying it.

> For the free worker: the deterritorialization of the soil through privatization; the decoding of the instruments of production through appropriation; the loss of the means of consumption through the dissolution of the family and the corporation; and finally, the decoding of the worker in favor of the work itself or of the machine. And for capital: the deterritorialization of wealth through monetary abstraction; the decoding of the flows of production through merchant capital; the decoding of States through financial capital and public debts; the decoding of the means of production through the formation of industrial capital; and so on.
> [@deleuze1983, 235]

### Cynic piety
> Let us consider more in detail how the elements come together, with the conjunction of all their processes. It is no longer the age of cruelty or the age of terror, but the age of cynicism, accompanied by a strange piety. (The two taken together constitute humanism: cynicism is the physical immanence of the social field, and piety is the maintenance of a spiritualized Urstaat; cynicism is capital as the means of extorting surplus labor, but piety is this same capital as God-capital, whence all the forces of labor seem to emanate.)
> [@deleuze1983, 225]

### Capital's Grasp on Production
The effect of the conjunction is indeed the tighter and tighter grasp of the capital over production. Conjunction of the all dcoded, deterritorialised flows cannot be defined by the financial capital or commercial capital, the industrial capital is the definitive element of the capitalism. Capitalist machine is not yet established until capital directly appropriates production and until financial capital as well as commercial capital are merely functions corresponding to the division of labor in the capitalist mode of prodcution.

Capital becomes filiative when money begets money, or value a surplus value (by itself); suddenly it presents itself as an independent substance. [@deleuze1983, 227]

> Nay more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into relations with itself. It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value; as the father differentiates himself qua the son, yet both are one and of one age: for only by the surplus-value of £10 does the £100 originally advanced become capital."

Under these conditions, the capital becomes the full body (conditions for constraining, incorporating organs have been established), the new socius or the quasi cause that appropriates all the productive forces. 

Contradictions are not what brings social systems down, on the contrary they are the very motors which gives society its dynamism.

> it is in order to function that a social machine must not function well. \[…\] The death of a social machine has never been heralded by a disharmony or a dysfunction; on the contrary, social machines make a habit of feeding on the contradictions they give rise to, on the crises they provoke, on the anxieties they engender, and on the infernal operations they regenerate. Capitalism has learned this, and has ceased doubting itself, while even socialists have abandoned belief in the possibility of capitalism's natural death by attrition. No one has ever died from contradictions. And the more it breaks down, the more it schizophrenizes, the better it works, the American way.

Between the money of the wage earner and the money of financier; between the money that only functions as payment (alliance) and the money that functions as finance (filiation). Capitalism learned to capitalise of its contradictions.  Contrrapitalism learned to capitalise of its contradictions. 

No matter how profitable en investment is, the profit always diminishes over time, this is the reason why capitalism follows the *booms*. This is the reason of outsourcing, to keep profit rate high but it rarely ever translates into benefits for costumers.

Capitalism is at the end conservative. Why. It only supports creativity and innovation if it is profitable. Anything beyond "the scientifical necessity" is delayed until they are profitable.

The role of the state has changed since the despotic machine. It no longer absorbs surplus value, but adds to it by creating the conditions which capitalism thrives (neoliberal governmentality). 

Capitalism stimulates overproduction on the one hand via a radical process of decoding; but also retards that prodcution by insinuating anti-production into every level of society.

> Thus to use  our previous example, if sex before marriage was prohibited in  primitive society because it offended the gods, then in the despotic  regime it was prohibited because it threatened the smooth transfer  of capital (e.g., children born out of wedlock could not inherit  property).  Capitalist decoding evacuates the meaning out of all codes, that  is to say all the rules, regulations, laws, codes of conduct, and so  forth, rendering them completely arbitrary, or rather purely functional. Decoding in this context doesn't mean interpretation or deciphering, it literally means taking the code away. Taking their place  is the axiomatic.65 'Why not merely say that capitalism replaces one  code with another, that it carries into effect a new type of coding?'  (AO, 268/294). Because the axiomatic is different in kind to the code;  it is unavowable:  there is not a single economic orfinancialoperation that, assuming it is translated in terms of code, would not lay bare its own  unavowable nature, that is, its intrinsic perversion or essential  cynicism (the age of bad conscience is also the age of pure cynicism). (AO, 268/294)
> Capitalism is not something we can believe in - not even those free  marketers who profess to 'believe' in the market actually do, otherwise they would not also demand its regulation. The US demands  free access to global markets, but does not reciprocate: its markets  are tightly controlled. But having said that, capitalism'sflowsaren't  codeable: money is a general equivalent giving common measure to  all things, but in itself floats free of all attempts to give it meaning  (such as the gold standard that once served to guarantee currency)  (AO, 269-70/294).
> Capitalism doesn't require our belief to function, but it does  require regulation. It unleashes flows that need damping if they  aren't to carry the system itself into ruin. It needs to produce antiproduction as well as production. The drive to innovation needs to  be countered by the manufacture of stupidity. The State, its police,  and its army form a gigantic enterprise of anti-production, but at the  heart of production itself, and conditioning this production.' (AO,  256/280). The apparatus of anti-production serves two key functions:
 [@buchanan2008e, 112]

One can say, the schizophrenia is the exterior limit of capitalism itlself or the conclusion of its deepest tendency. It constantly decodes flows leading to schizophrenic borders, it doesn't try to recode those flows but is in need of *anti-production* to keep the flows from flowing over its borders.

> In effect, modern societies are torn in two directions: 'archaism and  futurism, neoarchaism and ex-futurism, paranoia and schizophrenia' (AO, 282/309-10).

>In effect, modern societies are torn in two directions: 'archaism and  futurism, neoarchaism and ex-futurism, paranoia and schizophrenia' (AO, 282/309-10). What is crucial to understand in all this is  that the relations of alliance andfiliationwhich structure all types of   society no longer apply to people, as they did in the previous territorial and despotic regimes.
In the modern state, these relations apply to money. In this situation, 'the family becomes a microcosm, suited to expressing what it no longer dominates' (AO, 286/315). The family becomes an object of consumption in the modern system. It is on this terrain that Oedipus can finally take root. T h e Oedipal triangle is the personal and private territoriality that corresponds to all of capitalism's efforts at social reterritorialisation.' (AO, 289/317). Its purpose is to neutralize the threat of schizophrenia, the modern capitalist machine's absolute limit, by creating an interior limit to the movement of desire that pulls it up short of the exterior limit (i.e., schizophrenia).

### The Bank
> In a sense, it is the bank that controls the whole system and the investment of desire.* One of Keynes's contributions was the reintroduction of desire into the problem of money; it is this that must be subjected to the requirements of Marxist analysis. That is why it is unfortunate that Marxist economists too often dwell on considerations concerning the mode of production, and on the theory of money as the general equivalent as found in the first section of Capital, without attaching enough importance to banking practice, to financial operations, and to the specific circulation of credit money—which would be the meaning of a return to Marx, to the Marxist theory of money.
> [@deleuze1983, 230]

### Limits of Deterritorialisation
Deterritorialisation goes from the centre to the periphery. For example from developed countries to underdeveloped countries. A process of *development of underdevelopment* ensures a rise in the rate of surplus value on the periphery in the form of an increasing exploitation of the peripjeral proletariat in relation to that of the centre. It is not the exports from the traditional sectors or achaic territorrialities that primarily originate but they come from modern industries and plantations that generate an immense surplus value, to the point where it is not the develiped countries that supply the underdeveloped countries but vice versa. [see @deleuze1983, 231]

> At the same time as capitalist deterritorialization is developing from the center to the periphery, the decoding of flows on the periphery develops by means of a "disarticulation" that ensures the ruin of traditional sectors, the development of extraverted economic circuits, a specific hypertrophy of the tertiary sector, and an extreme inequality in the different areas of productivity and in incomes.75 Each passage of a flux is a deterritorialization, and each displaced limit, a decoding. Capitalism schizophrenizes more and more on the periphery. It will be said that, even so, at the center the falling tendency retains its restricted sense, i.e., the relative diminution of surplus value in relation to total capital—a diminution that is ensured by the development of productivity, automation, and constant capital.

### Innovation
Deleuze and Guattari argue that both human and machinic surplus value are central to capitalism, but neither derives directly from labour or innovation themselves; rather, they are captured and governed by the broader capitalist axiomatic, which regulates flows of knowledge, technics, and labour through abstract market logics. **Machinic surplus value, emerging from scientific and technical processes, becomes valuable only when capital deems it profitable, not when it becomes technically feasible**. Innovations are therefore delayed until market conditions justify their exploitation, and both human labour and knowledge are treated as incommensurable with capital’s returns. Crucially, producing surplus value is insufficient—capitalism must also absorb it through mechanisms like advertising, bureaucracy, militarism, and imperialism. The state plays a key role here, adding value by mobilising and absorbing surplus through non-competitive channels such as defence spending. This process ensures that capitalism can expand and reproduce itself by continuously pushing against its own limits, while the flows of labour and knowledge remain subordinated to the axioms of global capital.

In this regard, the State's role is to add to the surplus value of the firms by bringing capitalist economy to its full output within the given limits instead of absorbing anything from their surplus, as in military spending contrary to any competitive role against the private entitites establishment of their exploitation.

### Antiproduction & Lack
The State, its police, and its army form a gigantic enterprise of antiproduction. While capitalism ever produces in expanding interior limits, it also produces the antiproduction in the production itself. The forces of antiproduction are involved in the process of production to monitor and regulate or ensure the surplus value realisation. On the one hand, it alone is capable of realising capitalism's supreme goal, which is to produce lack in large aggregates, to introduce lack where there is always too much. And on the other side it alone doubles the capital and the flow of knowledge with a capital an equivalent flow of stupidity that also effects an absorbtion and a realisation that ensures the integration of individuals and groups into the system [@deleuze1983, 238]

### Capitalist Production 
The (real) socialist States have more trouble with stopping unexpected flow leaages except by direct violence. It is not because capitalism is more flexible in this sense, but it is wider and more englobing. 

> Thus the three segments of the ever widening capitalist reproduction process are joined, three segments that also define the three aspects of its immanence: 
> - 1. the one that extracts human surplus value on the basis of the differential relation between decoded flows of labor and production, and that moves from the center to the periphery while nevertheless maintaining vast residual zones at the center; 
> - 2. the one that extracts machinic surplus value, on the basis of an axiomatic of the flows of scientific and technical code, in the "core" areas of the center; 
> - 3. and the one that absorbs or realizes these two forms of surplus value of flux by guaranteeing the emission of both, and by constantly injecting antiproduction into the producing apparatus. Schizophrenization occurs on the periphery, but it occurs at the center and at the core as well.
> [@deleuze1983, 237]

> In a certain sense, capitalist economists are not mistaken when they present the economy as being perpetually "in need of monetarization," as if it were always necessary to inject money into the economy from the outside according to a supply and a demand. In this manner the system indeed holds together and functions, and perpetually fulfills its own immanence. In this manner it is indeed the global object of an investment of desire. The wage earner's desire, the capitalist's desire, everything moves to the rhythm of one and the same desire, founded on the differential relation of flows having no assignable exterior limit, and where capitalism reproduces its immanent limits on an ever widening and more comprehensive scale.
> [@deleuze1983, 239]

So, what might be the solution then? Psychoanalysis is little help, as it cannot recognise that an entire system of economic-monerary dependences at the heart of the desire of every subject it treats.

### Decoding
If capitalism is the universal truth, then it is so in the sense that makes capitalism the negative of all social formations. It is the thing unnameable, the generalised decoding of flows that reveals a contrario the secret of all these formations ^[1: Deleuze mentions also coding here but it doen't fit other descriptions of capitalism]. \[…\] All history therefore can be read under the sign of classes  which are the negatives of castes and ranks. For it is certain that the regime of decoding does not signify the absence of organisation, but rather the most somber organisation, the harshest compatibility, with the axiomatic replacing the codes and incorporating them, always a contrario [@deleuze1983, 153]

An example of the decoded flows:
> Michel Serres defines in this sense the correlation of the break and the flow in the signs of the new technical language machines, where production is narrowly determined by information: "Take for example a cloverleaf highway interchange…. It is a quasi point that analyses, through multiple overlappings, along a dimension that is normal to the network space, the lines of flow for which it serves as a receiver. On it one can go from any afferent direction to any efferent direction, and in whatever order, without ever encountering any of the other directions… . If I like, I will never come back to the same point, although it will be the same… . A topological knot where everything is connected without confusion, where everything flows together and is distributed… . Thus a knot may be seen as a point having several dimensions"—which, far from cancelling the flows, contains them and sets them in motion.84 This cordoning off of production through information shows once again that the productive essence of capitalism functions or "speaks" only in the language of signs imposed on it by merchant capital or the axiomatic of the market.
> [@deleuze1983, 241]

Civilisation at the end is defined by the decoding and the deterritorialisation of flows in capitalist production. Any method will do for ensuring this universal decoding. 
> the privatization brought to bear on property, goods, and the means of production, but also on the organs of "private man" himself; the abstraction of monetary quantities, but also the abstraction of the quantity of labor; the limitless nature of the relationship between capital and labor capacity, and between the flows of financing and the flows of incomes or means of payment; the scientific and technical form assumed by flows of code themselves; the formation of floating configurations starting from lines and points without a discernible identity.
#### Signifier
Deleuze and Guattari contrast traditional Saussurean linguistics—based on the transcendence and coded identity of signifiers—with Hjelmslev’s immanent, fluid model of language, where expression and content are interrelated flows rather than hierarchically ordered structures. They champion a shift from the dominance of the signifier to a theory of language grounded in desire, flux, and schizo-processes, where meaning arises from ruptures, breaks, and figural configurations rather than oppositional units. Drawing on Lyotard, they emphasise the importance of the figural—assignifying elements such as image, breath, or dream—that disrupt and override signifying chains. Yet, they critique Lyotard for ultimately reintroducing lack and castration into desire, thus restoring the tyranny of the signifier. Against this, they advocate for a theory of language and desire aligned with schizophrenia as process—where meaning and subjectivity are continually produced through deterritorialised flows, not predefined linguistic structures.[see @deleuze1983, 240-244]

#### The Nature of the Code
The code is not and can never be economic, on the contrary, it expresses the apparent objective movement according to which economic forces or productive connections are attributed to an extraeconomic instanse as though they emananted from it, an instance that serves as a support and an agent of inscription.

That is the reason why the sign of desire as an economic sign always accompanied by an extraeconomic power although its causes and effects lie within the economy. [see @deleuze1983, 248]. 

- [ ] There is lots to explore and understand here

Introducing money as an equivalent comes with the *functional addition* to begin and end with money, therefore to never end at all. This operational advancement decomposes the finite blocks of debt just by itself. The money being the abstract (infinite) quantity is the key to capital appropriating the whole production. 
BUT
> Hence capital differentiates itself from any other socius or full body, inasmuch as capital itself figures as a directly economic instance, and falls back on production without interposing extraeconomic factors that would be inscribed in the form of a code.
> 

#### The Limit
> Concerning capitalism, we maintain that it both does and does not have an exterior limit: it has an exterior limit that is schizophrenia, that is, the absolute decoding of flows, but it functions only by pushing back and exorcising this limit. And it also has, yet does not have, interior limits: it has interior limits under the specific conditions of capitalist production and circulation, that is, in capital itself, but it functions only by reproducing and widening these limits on an always vaster scale. The strength of capitalism indeed resides in the fact that its axiomatic is never saturated, that it is always capable of adding a new axiom to the previous ones. Capitalism defines a field of immanence and never ceases to fully occupy this field. But this deterritorialized field finds itself determined by an axiomatic, in contrast to the territorial field determined by primitive codes. Differential relations of such a nature as to be filled by surplus value; an absence of exterior limits that it is "filled" by the widening of internal limits; and the effusion of antiproduction within production so as to be filled by the absorption of surplus value—these constitute the three aspects of capitalism's immanent axiomatic. And monetarization everywhere comes to fill the abyss of capitalist immanence, introducing there, as Schmitt says, "a deformation, a convulsion, an explosion—in a word, a movement of extreme violence."8
> [@deleuze1983, 250]

#### Dividual
No one believes in anything anymore (<mark class="hltr-purple">the loss of the devoted man here?</mark>). Language no longer signifies something that must be believed (no coding, no overcoding, no reterritorialisation), it indicates rather what is going to be done, something that the shrewd or the competent are able to decode to half understand. \[…\] Then persons are no olonger themselves; your capital, your labor capacity, the rest is not important, we'll always fund a place for you within the expanded limits of the system, even if an axiom has to be created just for you.

### Axioms of Capitalism (Google)
Deleuze and Guattari, in their analysis of capitalism, identify three key axioms: ==the absolute heterogeneity of capitalist nation-states, production for the sake of production, and the immanence of capitalism's limits==. 

Here's a more detailed explanation: 

- **Heterogeneity of Nation-States:**
    
    Deleuze and Guattari argue that capitalist nation-states are not unified, but rather diverse models of realization for the capitalist axiomatic. They function as tools for realizing the abstract principles of capitalism, rather than as overarching structures.
    
- **Production for the Sake of Production:**
    
    Capitalism, according to Deleuze and Guattari, is characterized by a relentless drive to produce, not for consumption or human needs, but for the sake of expanding production itself. This is a fundamental principle of the capitalist system.
    
- **Immanence of Limits:**
    
    The limits of capitalism are not imposed from outside, but are inherent within the system itself. The conditions for capitalism's own demise are generated within its own dynamics, not by external forces.

### The Capitalist State
Deleuze and Guattari argue that the capitalist State represents a unique rupture from earlier State formations like the Urstaat and monarchic systems, which relied on overcoding to regulate social flows. Unlike these earlier forms, the capitalist State emerges from and operates within the conjunction of decoded, deterritorialized flows, making it both the product and regulator of capitalism’s immanent axiomatic system. This axiomatic is not invented by capitalism but constitutes capital itself, with the State now functioning primarily as a regulator of its breakdowns and expansions. Despite appearances, there has never been a truly “liberal” capitalism; rather, from its inception, capitalism relied on State support to control labor, manage production, and stabilize markets. As capitalism expands, it multiplies axioms to manage labor, unions, and even trivial phenomena, while keeping the fundamental logic of capital unchanged. The State, in turn, becomes increasingly involved in regulating these axiomatized flows—managing production, monetarization, and surplus value—thus reinforcing its role as an apparatus within capitalism’s global machinery.[see @deleuze1983, 253]

The State’s regulatory role is not about mediating between social classes, but about maintaining the conditions for capital’s universal functioning. From the perspective of the capitalist axiomatic, there is only one class—the bourgeoisie—because it embodies the decoding of all social flows, effectively dissolving traditional statuses and castes. Class struggle is thus interpreted as the expansion of the bourgeoisie’s project of generalized decoding. The result is not liberation but a new form of slavery: a field of immanence in which the distinction between production and antiproduction collapses, and all individuals—including the capitalist—become enslaved to the system’s relentless demand for accumulation. The capitalist is not a master in the traditional sense but a servant of capital, embodying a machine-driven compulsion to extract and reproduce surplus value, without even the justification of personal enjoyment. This represents a deeper and more internalised form of domination, where even the ruling class is subordinated to the imperatives of the social machine. [@deleuze1983, 254]

The capitalist system integrates all flows—wages, profits, financing—into a single axiomatic, rendering class distinctions theoretically obsolete from within the system’s own logic. The bourgeoisie emerges as a universal class not through ideology, but by decoding and integrating all social formations into capital’s continuous reproduction. The real opposition, then, is not between bourgeois and proletarian classes per se, but between those inside the axiomatic machine—servants of the capitalist flow—and those who break with it, such as the schizophrenic subject who escapes the axiomatic on the plane of the body without organs. Revolutionary praxis must construct a bipolar social field (bourgeoisie/proletariat), yet faces a paradox: even if the proletariat seizes the state, it inherits the same axiomatic problems of surplus extraction, planning, and market logic. Thus, socialist transformation risks reproducing capitalist structures, only with a bureaucratic or technocratic elite substituting the bourgeoisie, unless it radically reconfigures the machinery of desire and production.

### Desire vs. Interest
> Desire can never be deceived. Interests can be deceived, unrecognized, or betrayed, but not desire. Whence Reich's cry: no, the masses were not deceived, they desired fascism, and that is what has to be explained. It happens that one desires against one's own interests: capitalism profits from this, but so does socialism, the party, and the party leadership.
> [@deleuze1983, 257]

But what does make one desire against their own interest?

Civilised modern societies are defined by processes of decoding and deterritorialisation. But what they deterritorialise, they reterritorialise with the other hand. These [[neoterritorialities]] are often artificial, residual, and archaic. 

> but they are archaisms having a perfectly current function, our modern way of "imbricating," of sectioning off, of reintroducing code fragments, resuscitating old codes, inventing pseudo codes or jargons. Neoarchaisms, as Edgar Morin puts it. These modern archaisms are extremely complex and varied. Some are mainly folkloric, but they nonetheless represent social and potentially political forces (from domino players to home brewers via the Veterans of Foreign Wars Others are enclaves whose archaism is just as capable of nourishing a modern fascism as of freeing a revolutionary charge (the ethnic minorities, the Basque problem, the Irish Catholics, the Indian reservations). Some of these archaisms take form as if spontaneously, in the very current of the movement of deterritorialization (neighborhood territorialities, territorialities of the large aggregates, "gangs"). Others are organized or promoted by the State, even though they might turn against the State and cause it serious problems (regionalism, nationalism). The fascist State has been without doubt capitalism's most fantastic attempt at economic and political reterritorialization. But the socialist State also has its own minorities, its own territorialities, which re-form themselves against the State, or which the State instigates and organizes. (Russian nationalism, the territoriality of the party: the proletariat was only able to constitute itself as a class on the basis of artificial neoterritorialities; in parallel fashion, the bourgeoisie reterritorializes itself in forms that are at times the most archaic.)

Others are enclaves

### Limits of the Capital
The discovery of an abstract subjective essence of wealth, in labor or production and in desire as well is Marx' discovery of capitalism's fundamental function. The nature of wealth isn't to be sought on the side of the object, under exterior conditions, in the territorial despotic machine, but Marx also adds that this cynical disovery finds itself rectified by a new territorialisation in the form of a new fetishism or a new 'hypocrisy'. Production as the abstract subjective essence is discovererd only in the forms of property taht objectifies it all over again, that alienates it by reterritorialising it.

> on the one hand, capitalism can proceed only by continually developing the subjective essence of abstract wealth or production for the sake of production, that is, "production as an end in itself, the absolute development of the social productivity of labor"; but on the other hand and at the same time, it can do so only in the framework of its own limited purpose, as a determinate mode of production, "production of capital," "the self-expansion of existing capital."Under the first aspect capitalism is continually surpassing its own limits, always deterritorializing further, "displaying a cosmopolitan, universal energy which overthrows every restriction and bond"; but under the second, strictly complementary, aspect, capitalism is continually confronting limits and barriers that are interior and immanent to itself, and that, precisely because they are immanent, let themselves be overcome only provided they are reproduced on a wider scale (always more reterritorialization—local, world-wide, planetary). That is why the law of the falling tendency—that is, limits never reached because they are always surpassed and always reproduced—has seemed to us to have as a corollary and even as a direct manifestation, the simultaneity of the two movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.
> [@deleuze1983, 259]

The axiomatic of the modern societies oscilliates between two polls. Between [[Urstaat]] that they would like to reanimate as an overcoding and reterrritorialising entity; and the unfettered flows that carry them towards an absolute threshold. On the one side recoding with worldwide and local dictatorships but also decoding flows fluemt quantities of their capital and their populations.  On th e one side recoding with worldwide and local dictator ships but also redecoding flows fluemt quatmtitntities of capitaltheir capital and tehirheir polpultations. Archaism and Futurism, neoarchaism, and ex-futurism; paranoia and schizophrenia. 

But the events that restore a thing to life are not the same as those that give rise to it in the first place. Why do these Neoarchaisms do not resemble the older archaisms? Why does the bureaucracy and technocracy of the modern state do not resemble the despotic State? Because it is a matter in the one case of reterritorialising decoded flows, but in the other case of overcoding the territorial flows. 

> Each type of social machine produces a particular kind of representation whose elements are organized at the surface of the socius: the system of connotation-connection in the savage territorial machine, corresponding to the coding of the flows; the system of subordination-disjunction in the barbarian despotic machine, corresponding to over-coding; the system of co-ordination-conjunction in the civilized capitalist machine, corresponding to the decoding of the flows.

## LIMITS & the Family
- **Oedipus as a limit**  
  - "Limit" has multiple meanings:
    - As an inaugural event (beginning, a matrix)
    - As a structural function (mediation and relational grounding)
    - As an eschatological determination (the end)

- **Oedipus is a limit only in the eschatological sense**, akin to desiring-production:
  - Desiring-production operates at the **limits of social production**:
    - Decoded flows → limits of codes and territorialities
    - Body without organs (BwO) → limit of the socius

- **Absolute limit**:
  - When **schizo-flows pass through the wall**, scramble codes, and deterritorialize the socius
  - The **body without organs** becomes:
    - The **deterritorialized socius**
    - A **wilderness** where decoded flows run free
    - A **symbol of the end of the world / apocalypse**

- **Relative limit**:
  - **Capitalism** is the relative limit:
    - It engineers and mobilizes **decoded flows**
    - Replaces traditional codes with a **quantifying axiomatic**
      - A more **oppressive regime**
    - It **approaches the wall** (limit) while **pushing it further away**

- **Schizophrenia vs. Capitalism**:
  - **Schizophrenia** = absolute limit
  - **Capitalism** = relative limit

- **All social formations sense and resist the limit**:
  - They **foresee or fear the real form** of the limit
  - Pre-capitalist formations:
    - **Encase** the merchant and technician
    - Prevent **money and production flows** from gaining autonomy
    - Maintain control by **preserving their codes** [see @deleuze1983 175]
> Precisely because the family, when opened to alliances, is coextensive with and adequate to the social historical field; because it animates social reproduction itself; because it mobilizes or causes passage of the detachable fragments without ever converting them into a detached object—no reduction whatever, no application is possible that would answer to the formula 3+1 (the four corners of the field folded into three, like a tablecloth, plus the transcendent term that performs the folding operation). [@deleuze1983, 177]

> ?? The organs and the agents of the latter no longer pass through a coding of flows of alliance and filiation, but through an axiomatic of decoded flows. Consequently, the capitalist formation of sovereignty will need an intimate colonial formation that corresponds to it, to which it will be applied, and without which it would have no hold on the productions of the unconscious.??

The family becomes the subaggregate to which the whole of the social field is applied. Since each person has his own private father and mother, it is a distributive subaggregate that simulates for each person the collective whole of social persons and that closes off his domain and scrambles his images. Everything is reduced to the father-mother-child triangle, which reverberates the answer "daddy-mommy" every time it is stimulated by the images of capital. [@deleuze1983, 265]

> [!quote] 
> Oedipus at last: in the end it is a very simple operation, one that indeed readily lends itself to formalization, although it involves universal history. We have seen in what sense schizophrenia was the absolute limit of every society, inasmuch as it sets in motion decoded and deterritorialized flows that it restores to desiring-production, "at the bounds" of all social production. And capitalism, the relative limit of every society, inasmuch as it axiomatizes the decoded flows and reterritorializes the deterritorialized flows. We have also seen that capitalism finds in schizophrenia its own exterior limit, which it is continually repelling and exorcising, while capitalism itself produces its immanent limits, which it never ceases to displace and enlarge. But capitalism still needs a displaced interior limit in another way: precisely in order to neutralize or repel the absolute exterior limit, the schizophrenic limit; it needs to internalize this limit, this time by restricting it, by causing it to pass no longer between social production and the desiring-production that breaks away from social reproduction, but inside social production, between the form of social reproduction and the form of a familial reproduction to which social production is reduced, between the social aggregate and the private subaggregate to which the social aggregate is applied.
> [@deleuze1983, 266]

Oedipus is this displaed or internalised limit where desire lets itself to be caught. The Oedipal triangle is the personal and private territoriality that corresponds to all of capitalism's efforts at social reterritorialization.

> In Oedipus there is a recapitulation of the three states, or the three machines. For Oedipus makes ready in the territorial machine, as an empty unoccupied limit. It takes form in the despotic machine as a symbolically occupied limit. But it is filled and carried to completion only by becoming the imaginary Oedipus of the capitalist machine. The despotic machine preserved the primitive territorialities, and the capitalist machine resuscitates the Urstaat as one of the poles of its axiomatic, it makes the despot into one of its images.

>This is what Foucault has shown in his very fine analysis: the familialism inherent in psychoanalysis doesn't so much destroy classical psychiatry as shine forth as the latter's crowning achievement. After the madman of the earth and the madman of the despot comes the madman of the family; what nineteenth-century psychiatry had wanted to organize in the asylum—"the imperative fiction of the family," Reason-the-father and madness-the-child or minor, the parents who are ill only from their own childhood—all this finds its fulfillment outside the asylum, in psychoanalysis and in the consulting room of the analyst. Freud is the Luther and the Adam Smith of psychiatry. He mobilizes all the resources of myth, of tragedy, of dreams, in order to re-enslave desire, this time from within: an intimate theater. Yes, Oedipus is nevertheless the universal of desire, the product of universal history—but on one condition, which is not met by Freud: that Oedipus be capable, at least to a certain point, of conducting its autocritique.

psychoanalysis, particularly through the figure of Oedipus, has functioned not to liberate desire but to recapture and territorialize it within the family structure, turning what should be a flow of social and political investments into an internalized theater of guilt, castration, and neurosis. Oedipus, rooted in the despotic signifier, becomes the final simulacrum under capitalism, flattening all desiring production into the narrow coordinates of father-mother-child. They critique Lacan’s symbolic framework for reinserting lack into desire via castration, thus maintaining the law of the despot in a new guise. Psychoanalysis, rather than destroying classical psychiatry, becomes its crowning extension—relocating madness from the asylum into the familial scene and the analyst’s office. Freud is compared to Luther and Adam Smith, revolutionary in determining the abstract essence of sexuality and desire, but reactionary in reterritorializing this essence within the private family. Schizoanalysis, in contrast, aims to uncover the collective, machinic nature of desire, to break through the familial simulacrum, and to return desire to its social investments and group fantasies—ultimately replacing the theater of representation with the productive flows of desiring-machines.
## Sexuality, libidinal investment, unconscious
> Sexuality is no longer regarded as a specific energy that unites persons derived from the large aggregates, but as the molecular energy that places molecules-partial objects (libido) in connection, that organizes inclusive disjunctions on the giant molecule of the body without organs (numen), and that distributes states of being and becoming according to domains of presence or zones of intensity (voluptas). For desiring-machines are precisely that: the microphysics of the unconscious, the elements of the microunconscious. But as such they never exist independently of the historical molar aggregates, of the macroscopic social formations that they constitute statistically. In this sense, **there is only desire and the social**. Beneath the conscious investments of economic, political, religious, etc., formations, there are unconscious sexual investments, microinvestments that attest to the way in which desire is present in a social field, and joins this field to itself as the statistically determined domain that is bound to it. Desiring-machines function within social machines, as though they maintained their own regime in the molar aggregates that they form at the level of large numbers. Symbols and fetishes are manifestations of desiring-machines. Sexuality is by no means a molar determination that is representable in a familial whole; it is the molecular underdetermination functioning within social and secondarily familial aggregates that trace desire's field of presence and its field of production: an entire non-Oedipal unconscious that will only produce Oedipus as one of its secondary statistical formations ("complexes"), at the end of a history bringing into play the destiny of social machines, their regime compared to that of desiring-machines.
