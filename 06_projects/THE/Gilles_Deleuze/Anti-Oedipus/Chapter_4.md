# Chapter_4
![[Pasted image 20250410155053.png]]

There is no parental pre-existence.

The formation of the family resembles the social machines; father the despot etc. 

Social relations are the first in relation to the familial investments.

The family is a nucleitic application of the social machine. "The application of reduction (rabattement) of the social investments"

1. The paranoiac, despot father oedipalizes the son
2. Regression keeps us in a simple reproduction cycle
3. First thing for child to repress is the unconscious of the father and the mother. Family is never determining, always determined.

- Oedipus presupposes a paranoiac investment, and dependent of paranoiac territoriality

## Social Investment
Every social investment is made on the socius itself as a full body and that their respective poles necessarily relate to the character or the map of this socius; earth, despot, or capital-money.

**Paranoiac investment** (Molar Aggregates): The paranoiac oppposes them to one another maneuvers them. The paranoiac engineers the masses, he is the artist of the large molar aggregates, the statistical formations or gregariousness, the phenomena of organised crowds. **EINHEIT**

==Does it also make it continuous?== instead of discrete

**Schizo Investment** (Molecular Elements):

> But the two kinds of investments are radically different, according as the one bears upon the molar structures that subordinate the molecules, and the other on the contrary bears upon the molecular multiplicities that subordinate the structured crowd phenomena. One is a subjugated group investment, as much in its sovereign form as in its colonial formations of the gregarious aggregate, which socially and psychically represses the desire of persons; the other, a subject-group investment in the transverse multiplicities that convey desire as a molecular phenomenon, that is, as partial objects and flows, as opposed to aggregates and persons.
> [@deleuze1983, 280]

But apparently the paranoiac and schizo do not operate on socius, rather on teh BWO.

> Every unconscious investment mobilizes a delirious interplay of disinvestments, of counterinvestments, of overinvestments. But we have seen in this context that there were two major types of social investment, segregative and nomadic, just as there were two poles of delirium: first, a paranoiac fascisizing (fascisans) type or pole that invests the formation of central sovereignty; overinvests it by making it the final eternal cause for all the other social forms of history; counterinvests the enclaves or the periphery; and disinvests every free "figure" of desire—yes, I am your kind, and I belong to the superior race and class. And second, a schizorevolutionary type or pole that follows the lines of escape of desire; breaches the wall and causes flows to move; assembles its machines and its groups-in-fusion in the enclaves or at the periphery—proceeding in an inverse fashion from that of the other pole: I am not your kind, I belong eternally to the inferior race, I am a beast, a black. Good people say that we must not flee, that to escape is not good, that it isn't effective, and that one must work for reforms. But the revolutionary knows that escape is revolutionary—withdrawal, freaks—provided one sweeps away the social cover on leaving, or causes a piece of the system to get lost in the shuffle. What matters is to break through the wall, even if one has to become black like John Brown. George Jackson. 'I may take flight, but all the while I am fleeing, I will be looking for a weapon!'5
> [@deleuze1983, 277]

> And the child does not wait until he is an adult before grasping—underneath father-mother—the economic, financial, social, and cultural problems that cross through a family: his belonging or his desire to belong to a superior or an inferior "race," the reactionary or the revolutionary tenor of a familial group with which he is already preparing his ruptures and his conformities.

## 3 Tasks

### 1. Negative Task
The principal destructive task is the elimination of reterrritorialisation, it is a constant threat \[…\] Our territories are our addictions, our perversions. Perversion  for Deleuze and Guattari is simply reterritorialization by another name [@buchanan2008e, 120].

U: Is it not just demystification of the enlightenment?

### 2. First Positive Task
> The 'true activities of the unconscious, causing toflowand breaking  flows, consist of the passive synthesis itself insofar as it ensures the  relative coexistence and displacement of the two different functions'  (AO, 357/388). Partial objects and the desiring-machines that mobilize them are the machinic components of the unconscious. As we  have seen, these machinic components are blocked in their operation  by a variety of different agents of repression - there is the body  without organs itself, which corresponds to what psychoanalysis  refers to as 'primary repression', then there are mechanisms of  society itself, which correspond to what psychoanalysis calls 'secondary repression' or 'repression proper'.
> [@buchanan2008e, 122]

thus the first essential task of schizoanalysis is to disrupt  the coincidence of the two, thus denying primary repression its reinforcement in the form of secondary repression and secondary  repression its justification in the form of primary repression. Having  done that, the schizoanalyst has to retool the relations of attraction  and repulsion that characterize the union of primary and secondary  repression in such a way as to enable the unconscious to become productive again. By this means it enables desiring-machines to renew  their operation

D&G vaguely defines 2 ways desiring machines to form a formation. First by taking the form of a common disjunction. Say they operate different functions but by overlapping completely, distinct but together, and two, by forming permutations becoming one to another on a long passage. [see @deleuze1983, 235]. And the BwO is produced as a whole alongside the parts, it is not totalising but added to them.

The subjective essence of production is revealed in capitalism: precisely because the limit becomes internal to capitalism, which continually reproducees it , and alsoi continually reoccupies it as an internalised and displaced limit. 

The decoded and deterritorialised flows of capitalism are not recaptured or co-opted, but directly apprehended in a codeless axiomatic that consigns them to the unicerse of subjective representation.

There is a double alienation between labour and desire

(GPT)
 by fully decoding and deterritorializing social and libidinal flows, reveals the shared subjective essence of labor and desire—but only to divide and repress them in increasingly violent ways. Unlike earlier societies, capitalism does not rely on symbolic codes but on axioms that relegate labor to private property and desire to the privatized family. This double alienation intensifies the division between desiring-production and social production, embedding repression directly within desire. Death becomes a dispersed instinct linked to capital’s antiproduction, circulating as libidinal energy in a mortuary axiomatic where even seemingly liberated desires are entangled with dead images. Against this backdrop, schizoanalysis emerges not as interpretation but as micromechanical inquiry. It aims to identify and reconnect the subject’s desiring-machines—libido, energy flows, syntheses—while dismantling molar structures like Oedipus, castration, and interpretive fantasies that trap the unconscious in representational illusions. Schizoanalysis follows lines of escape and strives to reanimate blocked desire by converting primal repression into productive functioning. It transforms repulsion into functioning intensity, allowing desiring-machines to operate freely once more. In contrast to psychoanalysis, which reproduces repression under the guise of therapeutic insight, schizoanalysis seeks to break through imposed images and restore the unconscious to its real, machinic creativity.
 [see @deleuze1983, 339]
#### Bodily definitions
In this dense and foundational passage, Deleuze and Guattari describe how desiring-machines function through **passive syntheses**—non-organized, indirect connections between **partial objects** (mouth, anus, etc.) that emit and break flows. These connections are not structured by identity but by fluid, overlapping, and permutational relationships, forming complex patterns of desire. The **body without organs (BwO)** is introduced not as the negation of the body or its parts, but as a **field of immanence** that supports, modulates, and organizes these flows without forming a unified organism. It is produced through the first synthesis of connection, existing both as a passive surface and as a point of intensity, repelling or attracting partial objects without integrating them into a totality. The **BwO and partial objects** are thus not opposed, but **co-constitutive**: the BwO provides the immanent substance (in a Spinozist sense), and the partial objects are its distinct, non-exclusive attributes. Together, they form the **material infrastructure of desire** in the schizoanalytic framework—partial objects as working micromachines, and the BwO as the immobile motor or raw matter through which desire is produced as molecular intensity. This model radically departs from psychoanalytic representations of the organism, offering instead a **non-Oedipal, non-organic, and processual ontology of desire**.
326

#### Death Instinct
> We say, to the contrary, that there is no death instinct because there is both the model and the experience of death in the unconscious. Death then is a part of the desiring-machine,a part that must itself be judged, evaluated in the functioning of the machine and the system of its energetic conversions, and not as an abstract principle.
> [@deleuze1983, 332]

### 3. Second Positive Task
Sexuality cannot be liberated if it does not first of all dismantle the  mechanism of sexual difference. Deleuze and Guattari's position  regarding sexuality is radical in its simplicity. Sexual difference  would not exist, they argue, if it did not serve the interest of power.  Culturally we only observe and indeed obsess about the biological  differences between the sexes because it is in our social interest to do  so. Sexual difference is a means by which power exerts itself. The  point is that sexual liberation, whether of women or men, or homosexuals, transsexuals, and so on, is not achieved by extending 'rights'  of enjoyment to all interested parties, but by working to extinguish  the factor of interest altogether. One has to get rid of both the  problem and the solution.

## The Second Positive Task
The historico-social field is no less invested by the schizo than the paranoica, the former says I am of a race inferior all eternity while the latter says I am oif a superior race.

> At one of the poles the large aggregates, the large forms of gregariousness, do not prevent the flight that carries them along, and they oppose to it the paranoiac investment only as an "escape in advance of the escape." But at the other pole, the schizophrenic escape itself does not merely consist in withdrawing from the social, in living on the fringe: it causes the social to take flight through the multiplicity of holes that eat away at it and penetrate it, always coupled directly to it, everywhere setting the molecular charges that will explode what must explode, make fall what must fall, make escape what must escape, at each point ensuring the conversion of schizophrenia as a process into an effectively revolutionary force. For what is the schizo, if not first of all the one who can no longer bear "all that": money, the stock market, the death forces, Nijinsky said—values, morals, homelands, religions, and private certitudes? There is a whole world of difference between the schizo anu the revolutionary: the difference between the one who escapes, and the one who knows how to make what he is escaping escape, collapsing a filthy drainage pipe, causing a deluge to break loose, liberating a flow, resecting a schiz.
> [@deleuze1983, 341]

The schizo is not a revolutionary but the schizophrenic process is full of revolutionary potential. There are to options in escaping, either the paranoiac, conformist, and fascisizing; or the schizo and revolutionary. Courage is to flee instead of living an chained state.

==We are actually coming to the **leftist soiidarity** which is formed by the collection of individual dispersions and the **right wing unity** which is more or less becoming one== Molecular and Molar, schizo and paranoiac, it all boils down into it.

But how, how can the molecular investments, the molecular dispersion can form such strong bonds and formations as molar ones. How can the **schizophrenic dispersion** can compete or fight against **paranoiac unity**.

**The escape** on the paranoiac side only an escape in advance of escape, but the schizo escape is not an escape from the social but in a molecular way opening holes and line through and out, explode what needs to explode and enable the revolutionary.

> The choice is between one of two poles, the paranoiac counterescape that motivates all the conformist, reactionary, and fascisizing investments, and the schizophrenic escape convertible into a revolutionary investment. Maurice Blanchot speaks admirably of this revolutionary escape, this fall that must be thought and carried out as the most positive of events: "What is this escape? The word is poorly chosen to please. Courage consists, however, in agreeing to flee rather than live tranquilly and hypocritically in false refuges. Values, morals, homelands, religions, and these private certitudes that our vanity and our complacency bestow generously on us, have as many deceptive sojourns as the world arranges for those who think they are standing straight and at ease, among stable things. They know nothing of this immense flight that transports them, ignorant of themselves, in the monotonous buzzing of their ever quickening steps that lead them impersonally in a great immobile movement. An escape in advance of the escape. [Consider the example of one of these men] who, having had the revelation of the mysterious drift, is no longer able to stand living in the false pretences of residence. First he tries to take this movement as his own. He would like to personally withdraw. He lives on the fringe… . [But] perhaps that is what the fall is, that it can no longer be a personal destiny, but the common lot."37 In this regard, the first thesis of schizoanalysis is this; every investment is social, and in any case bears upon a sociohistorical field.
> [@deleuze1983, ?]

### Molar & Molecular Formations
*Gregariousness(herd instinct)*

> They effect a unification, a totalization of the molecular forces through a statistical accumulation obeying the laws of large numbers. This unity can be the biological unity of a species or the structural unity of a socius: an organism, social or living, is composed as a whole, as a global or complete object.

Partial objects of a molecular order seem like a lack in this formation, this is how desire is fused into lack.

- **Molecular**: Desire operates at a micro-level as **multiple, dispersed, productive flows** (_break-flows_, or _schizzes_)—without purpose, hierarchy, or structure.
    
- **Molar**: At a macro-level, these flows are **statistically aggregated** into large-scale forms—like the identity of a person, a society, or a species. This aggregation is based on laws of large numbers and leads to **totalization** and **unification**.

---

### **❓** 

#### **Where Does Lack Come From?**

- In molecular desiring-production, **there is no inherent lack**—just flows and connections.
    
- But in molar formations, partial objects (small pieces of desire, like mouth, anus, breast, etc.) are **reframed as lacking a whole**. It is claimed that the molecular formations lack a concept of a whole (ideology? Unity?)
    
- Similarly, the whole (e.g., “the body,” “the person”) is said to be **lacking something** because it is composed of parts.
    
- This mutual illusion of **part and whole lacking one another** is what **fuses desire to lack**.

Molar formation and the fusing of the lack to desire is the thing that gives lack a collective and personal end, desire in its molecular formation is devoid of any goal or intention.

> "Culture" as a selective process of marking or inscription invents the large numbers in whose favor it is exerted. That is why statistics is not functional but structural, and concerns chains of phenomena that selection has already placed in a state of partial dependence (the Markov chains). This can even be seen in the genetic code. In other terms, forms of gregariousness are never indifferent: they refer back to the qualified forms that produce them by creative selection. The order is not: gregariousness —> selection, but on the contrary, molecular multiplicity—>forms of selection performing the selection—> molar or gregarious aggregates that result from this selection.

Quite improtant, gregarious aggregates, formations of herd instinct happens according to/or in relation to the culture's selection that has been already determined.

 the earth, the despot, and capital—operate as **“full bodies”** that totalize and organize the dispersed flows of **desiring-production** into structured social systems. These formations, which Nietzsche called “formations of sovereignty,” assign meaning, purpose, and lack, acting as heavy, signifying unities (or _objectities_) that determine how society is ordered. Unlike the **body without organs**—the naked, immanent ground of desiring-production—these _full bodies_ emerge as **produced yet unengendered** structures: they appear as natural or divine preconditions but are actually the result of specific historical and material conditions. Their role is to unify and appropriate the productive forces (what Marxists call “useful labor”) by embedding them in a **socius**—a system that organizes, accumulates, and channels desire into **molar aggregates** like social institutions, norms, and identities. Thus, **social production is desiring-production** under specific conditions, shaped by these totalizing forms that transform molecular multiplicities into stable, hierarchical social orders.

### **🧩 The Central Problem**

**Why do people often invest their desire in repressive systems?**

- Why do individuals with revolutionary interests still desire reactionary structures?
    
- Why do some with reactionary interests become revolutionaries?

→ The **concept of ideology** is insufficient to explain this.

→ **Desire**, not **duty**, drives revolution—and repression.

---

### **🧨 Critique of Ideology**

- **Ideology** (as false belief, mystification, or deception) masks the real issue:
    
    - Desire functions **below ideology**, within the **libidinal economy**.
        
    - Wilhelm Reich’s question, “Why did the masses desire fascism?” was left unresolved because he stayed within ideological frameworks.

---

### **💡 Key Concepts**

#### **1.** 

#### **Libidinal Economy = Political Economy**

- **Political and libidinal economies** are two modes of investment in the **same social reality**.
    
- One is not “subjective” while the other is “objective”—both are real and material.
    
- Desire **invests social structures**, regardless of rational interest.

#### **2.** 

#### **Unconscious vs. Preconscious Investments**

- **Unconscious libidinal investment** does not align with conscious interests.
    
    - It explains why people **desire** oppressive systems.

- **Preconscious investment** reflects rational, interest-based choices.
    
    - But these can be **perturbed** by deeper libidinal investments.

---

### **🏛️ Desire and Power Formations**

#### **What does desire invest in?**

- Not in social goals or ends directly, but in **sovereign formations**:
    
    - The **body of the earth**, the **despot**, **capital**, etc.

- These **“full bodies”** appear as natural or divine preconditions—but are **produced historical formations**.
    
- They **do not have goals**; they **produce goals retroactively** to **mask their absurdity**.

> “A form of power is identical with the violence it exerts by its very absurdity.” – via Klossowski

---

### **🌀 The Paradox of Desire in Social Machines**

- Even people with no material interest in power may **libidinally love** the social machine.
    
- Conversely, people with interest may love it with **a different, irrational intensity**.
    
- **Desire desires the machine**, sometimes precisely **because it represses**.

---

### **🛠️ Example: Kafka’s “In the Penal Colony”**

- The officer’s passionate attachment to the torture machine exemplifies:
    
    - A **libidinal investment in repression itself**.
        
    - The aesthetic, perverse enjoyment of **the machine of power**.

---

### **🚫 Against Psychoanalysis**

- Psychoanalysis reduces desire to the **Oedipal triangle** and misrepresents repression:
    
    - It treats repression as a **psycho-symbolic phenomenon**, not a **social or machinic one**.

- Schizoanalysis, in contrast, follows:
    
    - **Desiring-machines** (libido, numen, voluptas),
        
    - **Syntheses** (connective, disjunctive, conjunctive),
        
    - And **lines of escape**, not interpretative reductions.

---

### **🔄 The Role of Primal Repression**

- **Repression begins** with the **body without organs** repelling desiring machines.
    
- This **primal repression** enables secondary, molar repression to lock in.
    
- **Schizoanalysis’s task**: to **unlock** this repression, allowing **desire to flow** again.

---

## **✅ Conclusion: The Machine of Repression Is Also Desired**

- People may desire **the very systems that crush them**—not out of ignorance, but due to **deep unconscious investments**.
    
- These investments are **not rational**, but they are **material**.
    
- Liberation must account not only for **interests** and **ideology**, but for **desire itself**.
[see @deleuze1983, 344-345]

==\[…\] One makes revolution out of desire, not duty==

Everything is objective and subjective as one wishes, the fact is that ==the lbidinal economy is no less objective than the political economy==

> Libidinal investment does not bear upon the regime of the social syntheses, but upon the degree of development of the forces or the energies on which these syntheses depend. It does not bear upon the selections, detachments, and remainders effected by these syntheses, but upon the nature of the codes and the flows that condition them.

There is a disinterested love for the social machine, of the form of power, and of the degree of development in and for themselves. "Oh, how beautiful the machine is!", there is an immense libidinal investment of a machine, not just technical but social, and through which desire desires its own repression.

Repressing desire not only for others but also in oneself, being the cop for others but also in oneself, that is what arouses, and it is not ideology, it is economy.

> Capitalism garners and possesses the force of the aim and the interest (power), but it feels a disinterested love for the absurd and nonpossessed force of the machine. Oh, to be sure, it is not for himself or his children that the capitalist works, but for the immortality of the system. A violence without purpose, a joy, a pure joy in feeling oneself a wheel in the machine, traversed by flows, broken by schizzes. Placing oneself in a position where one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the socius, looking for the right place where, according to the aims and the interests assigned to us, one feels something moving that has neither an interest nor a purpose. A sort of art for art's sake in the libido, a taste for a job well done, each one in his own place, the banker, the cop, the soldier, the technocrat, the bureaucrat, and why not the worker, the trade-unionist. Desire is agape.
> [@deleuze1983, 346]

The [[preconscious revolution]] refers to a new regime of social production with new aims and interests. 

> The preconscious revolution refers to a new regime of social production that creates, distributes, and satisfies new aims and interests. But the unconscious revolution does not merely refer to the socius that conditions this change as a form of power; it refers within this socius to the regime of desiring-production as an overthrown power on the body without organs. It is not the same state of flows and schizzes: in one case the break is between two forms of socius, the second of which is measured according to its capacity to introduce the flows of desire into a new code or a new axiomatic of interest; in the other case the break is within the socius itself, in that it has the capacity for causing the flows of desire to circulate following their positive lines of escape, and for breaking them again following breaks of productive breaks.

But these forms can be understood in two ways, depending on whether desire is enslaved to a structured molar aggregate that it constitutes under a given form of power and gregariousness, or whether it subjugates the large aggregate to the functional multiplicities that it itself forms on the molecular scale (it is no more a case of persons or individuals in this instance than in the other).

==A group can be revolutionary from the standpoint of a class interest and the preconscious investment but stay counter.-revolutinary, fascist, even police like from the standpoint of the libidinal investments.==

> A revolutionary group can already have reassumed the form of a subjugated group, yet be determined under certain conditions to continue to play the role of a subject-group. One is continually passing from one type of group to the other. Subject-groups are continually deriving from subjugated groups through a rupture of the latter: they mobilize desire, and always cut its flows again further on, overcoming the limit, bringing the social machines back to the elementary forces of desire that form them.*

*^How do we combat the deadly inclination that makes a group pass from its revolutionary libidinal investments to revolutionary investments that are simply preconscious investments or investments of interest, then to preconscious investments that are simply reformist? And where do we even situate such and such a group?*

### Drum Machine
It is certain that neither man or women are clearly defined personalities, but rather vibrations, flows, schizzes, and knots. The task of schizoanalysis is that of tirelessly taking apart egos and their presuppostions; liberating the prepersonal singularities they enclose and repress; mobilsing the flows \[…\] establishing always further and more sharply the schizzes well below conditions of identity; and assembling the desiring-machines that countersect everyone and group everyone with others. 

> For everyone is a little group (un groupuscule) and must live as such—or rather, like the Zen tea box broken in a hundred places, whose every crack is repaired with cement made of gold, or like the church tile whose every fissure is accentuated by the layers of paint or lime covering it (the contrary of castration, which is unified, molarized, hidden, scarred, unproductive). Schizoanalysis is so named because throughout its entire process of treatment it schizophrenizes, instead of neuroticizing like psychoanalysis.

### Breakthrough into breakdown
Schizophrenia is not a breakdown, it is a breakthrough, how is the schizophrenic ill produced then? Constructed on decoded flows that constitute its absolute limit, capitalism is constantly counteracting this tendency. Exorcizing its limit by substituting the internal limit, or via the expansion/adaptation of the axiomatic of flows that subjects this tendency to the harshest forms of despotism and repression. 

### ART
 because at their highest intensity, **true art (and science)** can unleash **deterritorialized flows** and form **desiring-machines**. Using the **Venetian School of painting** as an example, they show how, even within an established code (such as the Byzantine visual hierarchy), moments of artistic **breakthrough** emerge—particularly during times of crisis or transition, such as Venice’s capitalist decline in the 15th century. Artists like **Tintoretto and Lotto** began to break with vertical, coded composition, introducing **horizontal, transversal flows**, where bodies, organs, and gestures interact in liberated, schizo-like ways. These artworks disrupt the fixed meanings assigned to figures and forms, generating **lines of flight** and **libidinal intensities**: Christ becomes a **body without organs**, pierced and wounded not to symbolize suffering, but to emit flows of desire and profanation. Yet, these liberating flows are always at risk of being **recaptured**—through perspective, technique, or new pictorial axioms—into new territorialities. Still, genius in art signals a **break in the code**, a **movement beneath structures**, where flows escape signifiers and **attain an immanent kind of completion** without needing an external goal. True art thus serves as a **site of breakthrough**, a schizoid event that opens up new configurations of desire, even as power tries to seal them back in.
 [see @deleuze1983, 369]

> And perhaps this, as we have seen, is where we find the commodity value of art and literature: a paranoiac form of expression that no longer even needs to "signify" its reactionary libidinal investments, since these investments function on the contrary as its signifier; an Oedipal form of content that no longer even needs to represent Oedipus, since the "structure" suffices. But on the other, the schizorevolutionary, pole, the value of art is no longer measured except in terms of the decoded and deterritorialized flows that it causes to circulate beneath a signifier reduced to silence, beneath the conditions of identity of the parameters, across a structure reduced to impotence; a writing with pneumatic, electronic, or gaseous indifferent supports, and that appears all the more difficult and intellectual to intellectuals as it is accessible to the infirm, the illiterate, and the schizos, embracing all that flows and counterfiows, the gushings of mercy and pity knowing nothing of meanings and aims (the Artaud experiment, the Burroughs experiment). It is here that art accedes to its authentic modernity, which simply consists in liberating what was present in art from its beginnings, but was hidden underneath aims and objects, even if aesthetic, and underneath recodings or axiomatics: the pure process that fulfills itself, and that never ceases to reach fulfillment as it proceeds—art as "experimentation."*
> 370

### Capitalism
how **capitalism, as a formation of sovereignty**, radically transforms the way **power, repression, and desire** are organized. Unlike earlier societies, which relied on **territorial codes** (primitive societies) or **despotic overcoding** (empires), capitalism replaces these with a **social axiomatic**—a flexible, expanding set of abstract rules that regulates flows (of capital, labor, money, innovation) without needing to inscribe them directly on bodies. In this system, **desire is made to desire its own repression**, largely through images and representations (e.g. imperialism), and repression is internalized as part of the economic logic itself.
Capitalism functions by managing **decoded and deterritorialized flows** (e.g., money, labor, technology), not by recoding them but by **differentiating and regulating them** through a vast, self-replicating system of axioms. It extracts **surplus value** not through traditional exploitation of labor alone but through the **interaction of heterogeneous flows**: capital vs. labor, financing vs. income, markets vs. innovation. This surplus value appears as a **surplus of flux**, not reducible to a simple difference between two commensurable quantities.
The **ruling class** in capitalism, far from being sovereign in the traditional sense, is actually **subordinate to the capitalist machine**, functioning as its **operator and guardian**. Its income may seem merely different in scale from that of workers, but it operates at a different level—**managing the great flows of capital**, regulating the **interior limits** of capitalism, and perpetually expanding them.
Finally, the passage emphasizes **antiproduction**—capital’s built-in mechanism for **absorbing and repressing** surplus desire. Here, **military, bureaucratic, and police apparatuses** are not external to the economy but **produced by it**, channeling libidinal energy directly into mechanisms of repression. This makes **capitalism unique**: it is a system that **produces for production’s sake**, but only under conditions that ensure the **continuous repression and redirection of desire** toward capital’s maintenance and expansion.

The capitalist machine demands the full libidinal investment from its desiring-machines without any predefined return (Kafka's Trial?). 
>The great mutant flow of capital is pure deterritorialization, but it performs an equivalent reterritorialization when converted into a reflux of means of payment. The Third World is deterritorialized in relation to the center of capitalism but belongs to capitalism, being a pure peripheral territoriality of capitalism.

But no matter how large the profit extraction, it does not define capitalism, the full investment of libido into the great flow is the determining aspect of capitalism. Big capitalist, small capitalist who has little hopes of interest; doesn't matter, full extent libidinal investment. and this might be one of the better arguments against reformism.

### Revolutionary investment
> But it is not enough for the libido to invest a new social body corresponding to these new aims, in order for it to perform a revolutionary break at the unconscious level with the same mode as the preconscious break. In fact, the two levels do not function in the same mode. The new socius invested by the libido as a full body can very well function as an autonomous territoriality, but one that is caught and wedged in the capitalist machine, and is localizable in the field of its market.

> But the reverse is also true: capitalism is constantly escaping on all sides. Its productions, its art, and its science form decoded and deterritorialized flows that do not merely submit to the corresponding axiomatic, but cause some of their currents to pass through the mesh of the axiomatic, underneath the recodings and the reterritorializations. Subject-groups in their turn derive from subjugated groups by way of ruptures in the latter. Capitalism is continually cutting off the circulation of flows, breaking them and deferring the break, but these same flows are continually overflowing, and intersecting one another according to schizzes that turn against capitalism and slash into it.

> In each case the problem is different: it is not enough to construct a new socius as full body; one must also pass to the other side of this social full body, where the molecular formations of desire that must master the new molar aggregate operate and are inscribed. Only by making this passage do we reach the revolutionary break and investment of the libido.

<mark class="hltr-red">At the and, art and science have a revolutionary role, and nothing more. Art and science cause increasingly decoded and deterrritorialised flows that are perceptible to everyone.</mark>

#### Desire
> Secondly, we have not at all minimized the importance of preconscious investments of class or interest, which are based in the infrastructure itself. But we attach all the more importance to them as they are the index in the infrastructure of a libidinal investment of another nature, and that can coincide as well as clash with them. Which is merely a way to pose the question, "How can the revolution be betrayed?"—

> And if we put forward desire as a revolutionary agency, it is because we believe that capitalist society can endure many manifestations of interest, but not one manifestation of desire, which would be enough to make its fundamental structures explode, even at the kindergarten level. We believe in desire as in the irrational of every form of rationality, and not because it is a lack, a thirst, or an aspiration, but because it is the production of desire: desire that produces—real-desire, or the real in itself.

#### Schizo
> Finally, we do not at all think that the revolutionary is schizophrenic or vice versa.

> The schizophrenic process (the schizoid pole) is revolutionary, in the very sense that the paranoiac method is reactionary and fascist; and it is not these psychiatric categories, freed of all familialism, that will allow us to understand the politico-economic determinations, but exactly the opposite.

## 4 Theses
Anti-Oedipus concludes by mapping out four theses that in sum  characterize the schizoanalytic project as a whole:  
1. Every libidinal investment of the unconscious is social and bears upon a sociohistorical field (AO, 375/409). 
2. There are two types of social investments: there is the unconscious libidinal investment of the group or desire and the preconscious investment of class or interest (AO, 377/411). 
3. The non-familial libidinal investments of the unconscious have primacy over the familial investments of the unconscious (AO, 390/427).   
4. The unconscious social investments of desire can be of two main types: paranoid, reactionary and fascisizing or schizoid, revolutionary and Utopian (AO, 401/439).

### Cynicism
From Zizek: The new ideology is "We admit all of it, but you are also in it. You are co-responsible by participating, by consuming the fruits of this mechanism."

> For him the problem is pervasive  because its core attitude - encapsulated in the phrase he borrows from  Octave Mannoni: 'Je sais bien, mais quand meme …' ('I know very  125 DELEUZE AND GUATTARI'S ANTI-OEDIPUS  well, but all the same … ' ) - forms the basis of all social and cultural  behaviour, not only that which entails some kind of morally suspect  action.71 He doesn't say that we are all cynics, but he does suggest that  our normal mode of being in the world requires us to disavow knowledge and this renders us susceptible to a cynical outlook. Zizek has  countless examples of the everyday disavowal of knowledge he can  point to in support of his argument: I know that the paper money in  my wallet is really worthless, but all the same I act as though it is not;  I know Santa doesn't really exist, but all the same I act as though he  does
> [@buchanan2008e, 126]

Ideology is essentially a dual process of disavowing what one knows while reifying a false corollary.

> Here the commitment to Labour that is an essential plank of Leftist parties actually gets in the way of the larger  commitment to 'guaranteed life' because it puts the Left in the position of having to be, among other things, anti-immigration so as to  defend wage levels from erosion due to the importation of cheap  'foreign' labour. In Australia, it was the Labor Party that inaugurated the 'White Australia' policy for precisely this reason. It mobilized xenophobia to create a protected labour market. Cynicism  doesn't explain our situation because it doesn't provide a complicated enough account of how the electorate actually thinks and  functions. Neither does false consciousness. What's needed is an  analysis that shows how desire and interest can travel in different and  indeed conflicting directions. Cynicism short-circuits the properly  schizoanalytical contradiction the separation of desire and interest  allows us to formulate and makes it seem as though it is possible to  accommodate it. And that is precisely what schizoanalytical criticism should not allow: its purpose is exactly the opposite - to constantly point up the unendurability of the present

Both the 'false consciousness' and 'cynicism' arguments are  underpinned by what Deleuze calls a 'philosophical illusion' both presume that there is a truth 'out there' somewhere which the  good citizens of Kansas are either failing to see or seeing and failing  to acknowledge. Marxist doctrine is conditioned by the Utopian  view that if awareness of the real conditions of existence becomes  general enough then social change must occur because nobody  could knowingly support capitalism as it really is. This is, in effect,  the spectre Marx said was haunting Europe, the spectre of a truth  that once known cannot be tolerated. 'False consciousness' and cynicism are conjured to explain the demoralizing fact that in spite of a  century and more of consciousness-raising by the Left (in all its  manifestations) after which no one could be left in any doubt as to  the true nature of capitalist society, a spontaneous shift towards an  equitable form of socialism has not only not occurred, but the  minimal tokens of that Utopia (such as the minimum wage, the  public health system, old-age pension, and so on) are under threat  of extinction. It is the schism between knowledge ('I know capitalism is an inequitable system') and action ('but all the same'), or lack  thereof, as the case may be, that false consciousness and cynicism  attempt to explain. They reason that if we knew the truth about our  situation we would be compelled to act, therefore the fact that we do  not act must mean we have disavowed the truth either by suppressing all knowledge of it from ourselves or by choosing not to  acknowledge its implications. What we must prevent at all costs is  cynicism becoming this new truth that is always already out there,  because if that happens political thought, not to mention political  action, is finished. The problem today is that while citizens as consumers can be motivated to complain or change brands, it is all but  impossible to persuade them to act. Cynicism doesn't explain this  state of affairs, it excuses it. In this sense, cynicism is the new name  for what Foucault called fascism, as such Anti-Oedipus' message is  as vital and urgent today as it was when it was first published.

## BwO and the Socius
> The socius is not a projection of the body without organs; rather, the body without organs is the limit of the socius, its tangent of deterritorialization, the ultimate residue of a deterritorialized socius. The socius—the earth, the body of the despot, capital-money—are clothed full bodies, just as the body without organs is a naked full body; but the latter exists at the limit, at the end, not at the origin. And doubtless the body without organs haunts all forms of socius. But in this very sense, if social investments can be said to be paranoiac or schizophrenic, it is to the extent that they have paranoia and schizophrenia as ultimate products under the determinate conditions of capitalism.[@deleuze1983, 281]

## Machines and Subject
We see a machine as a whole, we call it by a name and we individualise it, we look at our limbs and know that the combinative actuon springs from a single centre of 
> We are misled by considering any complicated machine as a single thing; in truth it is a city or a society, each member of which was bred truly after its kind. We see a machine as a whole, we call it by a name and individualize it; we look at our own limbs, and know that the combination forms an individual which springs from a single centre of reproductive action; we therefore assume that there can be no reproductive action which does not arise from a single center; but this assumption is unscientific, and the bare fact that no vapour-engine was ever made entirely by another, or two others, of its own kind, is not sufficient to warrant us in saying that vapour-engines have no reproductive system. The truth is that each part of every vapour-engine is bred by its own special breeders, whose function is to breed that part, and that only, while the combination of the parts into a whole forms another department of the mechanical reproductive system."10 In passing, Butler encounters the phenomenon of surplus value of code, when a part of a machine captures within its own code a code fragment of another machine, and thus owes its reproduction to a part of another machine: the red clover and the bumble bee; or the orchid and the male wasp that it attracts and intercepts by carrying on its flower the image and the odor of the female wasp.

[@deleuze1983, 285]

There, the individual is actually produced as a residue the complex combination of the dividual aspects are given a name, but the individual in is just a byproduct.

At this point of dispersion of the two arguments, it becomes immaterial whether one says that machines are organs, or organs, machines. The two definitions are exact equivalents: man as a "vertebro-machinate mammal," or as an "aphidian parasite of machines." What is essential is not in the passage to infinity itself—the infinity composed of machine parts or the temporal infinity of the animalcules—but rather in what this passage blossoms into. Once the structural unity of the machine has been undone, once the personal and specific unity of the living has been laid to rest, a direct link is perceived between the machine and desire, the machine passes to the heart of desire, the machine is desiring and desire, machined. Desire is not in the subject, but the machine in desire—with the residual subject off to the side, alongside the machine, around the entire periphery, a parasite of machines, an accessory of vertebro-machinate desire. In a word, the real difference is not between the living and the machine, vitalism and mechanism, but between two states of the machine that are two states of the living as well. The machine taken in its structural unity, the living taken in its specific and even personal unity, are mass phenomena or molar aggregates; for this reason each points to the extrinsic existence of the other. And even if they are differentiated and mutually opposed, it is merely as two paths in the same statistical direction.

**molar machines**

**desiring-machines** : Desiring-rnachines are the following: formative machines, whose very misfirings are functional, and whose functioning is indiscernible from their formation; chronogeneous machines engaged in their own assembly(montage), operating by nonlocalizable intercommunications and dispersed localizations, bringing into play processes of temporalization, fragmented formations, and detached parts, with a surplus value of code, and where the whole is itself produced alongside the parts, as a part apart or, as Butler would say, "in another department" that fits the whole over the other parts; machines in the strict sense, because they proceed by breaks and flows, associated waves and particles, associative flows and partial objects, inducing—always at a distance—transverse connections, inclusive disjunctions, and polyvoca! conjunctions, thereby producing selections, detachments, and remainders, with a transference of individuality, in a generalized schizogenesis whose elements are the schizzes-flows.

## Markov CHAINS

- [ ] #todo/read Ruyer uyer,_La genese des formes vivantes,_ Ch. 8. The phenomena of surplus value of code are clearly explained in this perspective of "semifortuitous sequences." Several times Ruyer compares this with the language of schizophrenia.

In this sense it was possible to insist on a common characteristic of human cultures and of living species, as "Markov chains": aleatory phenomena that are partially dependent. In the genetic code as in the social codes, what is termed a signifying chain is more a jargon than a language (langage), composed of nonsignifying elements that have a meaning or an effect of signification only in the large aggregates that they constitute through a linked drawing of elements, a partial dependence, and a superposition of relays.+ It is not a matter of biologizing human history, nor of anthropologizing natural history. It is a matter of showing the common participation of the social machines and the organic machines in the desiring-machines. At man's most basic stratum, the Id: the schizophrenic cell, the schizo molecules, their chains and their jargons. There is a whole biology of schizophrenia; molecular biology is itself schizophrenic—as is microphysics. But inversely schizophrenia—the theory of schizophrenia—is biological, biocultural, inasmuch as it examines the machinic connections of a molecular order, their distribution into maps of intensity on the giant molecule of the body without organs, and the statistical accumulations that form and select the large aggregates.

## Representation
Family is not enough to repress the desiring-production and structure the unconscious. It is rather a representation of unconscious family introduces. Instead, there is a representation of unconscious through the family, a myth, a tragedy whatever.

## Psychoanalysis and Capitalism
The discovery of decoded flows is apparently the same as the subjective and abstract labor in terms of the political economy, and for the psychoanalysis (and in desiring-production), it is subjective and abstract libido.

the relationship between psychoanalysis and capitalism is structurally analogous to that between political economy and capitalism: both operate through the discovery and management of **decoded and deterritorialized flows**—of abstract labour in political economy and abstract libido in desiring-production. In capitalism, the subjective essence of production becomes real for the first time, enabling both political economy and psychoanalysis to reinterpret earlier formations as partial expressions of this general abstraction. Yet, even as capitalism uncovers this shared essence of desire and labour—productive activity in general—it immediately divides and represses it, splitting it into political economy and libidinal economy. Psychoanalysis thus functions within capitalism as a tool of **reterritorialization**, repelling the free flows of desire and enclosing them within Oedipal structures, just as capital encloses labour through its axiomatic. Capitalism depends on deterritorialization to operate, but it continuously reterritorializes artificially to contain its own destabilizing tendencies, turning even myth and tragedy into tools of capital. In this sense, psychoanalysis is not external to capitalism but intrinsic to its machinery of repression.
[see @deleuze1983, 303]

> [!quote] 
> Marx summarizes the entire matter by saying that the subjective abstract essence is discovered by capitalism only to be put in chains all over again, to be subjugated and alienated—no longer, it is true, in an exterior and independent element as objectify, but in the element, itself subjective, of private property: "What was previously being external to oneself—man's externalization in the thing—has merely become the act of externalizing—the process of alienating."
[@deleuze1983, 303]

SUbjective abstract labor is arbitrarily constructed, and so does the subjective abstract Desire as represented in the privatized family.

> the specific problem of myth and tragedy: with one hand psychoanalysis undoes the system of objective representations (myth, tragedy) for the benefit of the subjective essence conceived as desiring-production, while with the other hand it reverses this production in a system of subjective representations (dream and fantasy, with myth and tragedy posited as their developments or projections). Images, nothing but images. What is left in the end is an intimate familial theater, the theater of private man, which is no longer either desiring-production or objective representation. The unconscious as a stage. A whole theater put in the place of production, a theater that disfigures this production even more than could tragedy and myth when reduced to their meager ancient resources.

> [!warning] What does this mean (Implications regarding Amoore's World Model and also Hayat's pub.)
> Even in Louis Althusser we are witness to the following operation: the discovery of social production as "machine" or "machinery," irreducible to the world of objective representation (Vorstellung); but immediately the reduction of the machine to structure, the identification of production with a structural and theatrical representation (Darstellung).17 Now the same is true of both desiring-production and social production: every time that production, rather than being apprehended in its originality, in its reality, becomes reduced (rabattue) in this manner to a representational space, it can no longer have value except by its own absence, and it appears as a lack within this space. In search of the structure in psychoanalysis, Moustafa Safouan is able to present it as a "contribution to a theory of lack." It is in the structure that the fusion of desire with the impossible is performed, with lack defined as castration. From the structure there arises the most austere song in honor of castration— yes, yes, we enter the order of desire through the gates of castration— once desiring-production has spread out in the space of a representation that allows it to go on living only as an absence and a lack unto itself. For a structural unity is imposed on the desiring-machines that joins them together in a molar aggregate; the partial objects are referred to a totality that can appear only as that which the partial objects lack, and as that which is lacking unto itself while being lacking in them (the Great Signifier "symbolizable by the inherency of a -1 in the ensemble of signifiers"). Just how far will one go in the development of a lack of lack traversing the structure? Such is the structural operation: it distributes lack in the molar aggregate. The limit of desiring-production—the border line separating the molar aggregates and their molecular elements, the objective representations and the machines of desire—is now completely displaced. The limit now passes only within the molar aggregate itself, inasmuch as the latter is furrowed by the line of castration. The formal operations of the structure are those of extrapolation, application, and biunivocalization, which reduce the social aggregate of departure to a familial aggregate of destination, with the familial relation becoming "metaphorical for all the others" and hindering the molecular productive elements from following their own line of escape.
> [@deleuze1983, 306]

> Oedipus, castration, the signifier, etc., exist at the crossroads of two operations of capture: one where repressive social production becomes replaced by beliefs, the other where repressed desiring-production finds itself replaced by representations. To be sure, it is not psychoanalysis that makes us believe: Oedipus and castration are demanded, then demanded again, and these demands come from elsewhere and from deeper down. But psychoanalysis did find the following means, and fills the following function: causing beliefs to survive even after repudiation; causing those who no longer believe in anything to continue believing; reconstituting a private territory for them, a private Urstaat, a private capital (dreams as capital, said Freud).

Even the wildest deterritorialisations of the desiring machines are operation through some territorities and localisations. We take the elements of the terrritorialisations to build escapes (lines of flight)? Good passage: [@deleuze1983, 315]

## Saussurean Connections to Nomadic Deterritorialisations (Caution, might be a connection)

> Such is the case in the schizoid sequences of Beckett: stones, pockets, mouth; a shoe, a pipe bowl, a small limp bundle that is undefined, a cover for a bicycle bell, half a crutch ("if one indefinitely runs up against the same set of pure singularities, one can feel confident that he has drawn near the singularity of the subject's desire").

## ==Capitalism and Axiomativity (GOOGLE, @2019m)==
In the context of philosophy, particularly in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, "capitalism being axiomative" means that capitalism functions as a system of fundamental, self-evident principles (axioms) from which its operation and effects are derived. These axioms aren't based on logic or proof, but rather define the conditions and rules of the capitalist system. In this sense, capitalism's core principles are not subject to debate or justification, but rather function as the foundational truths from which the entire system operates. 

Elaboration:

- **Axiomatic System:**
    
    Deleuze and Guattari use the term "axiomatic" to describe how capitalism constructs itself. An axiom is a statement that is taken to be true without proof and serves as a starting point for a system of rules and reasoning. 

- **Core Axioms:**
 
 Deleuze and Guattari identify three key axioms of capitalism:
 
  - **Absolute Heterogeneity of Capitalist Nation-States:** Each capitalist state is seen as a unique and independent entity, not subject to a universal order. 

  - **Production for the Sake of Production:** The primary goal of capitalist activity is not to meet needs but to expand production itself, creating a constant drive for growth. 

  - **Immanent Limits:** The limitations of capitalism are seen as arising from within the system itself, not from external forces. 

- **Implications:**
    
    By understanding capitalism as an axiomatic system, Deleuze and Guattari argue that its operation is not necessarily tied to individual intentions or moral judgments, but rather follows from the inherent rules of the system itself. This perspective can help to understand how capitalism operates even when individuals might not fully understand or agree with its logic. 

- **Deleuze and Guattari's Critique:**
    
    Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the axiomatic is not a descriptive analysis of capitalism, but rather a critical one. By understanding capitalism as an axiomatic system, they argue that it is not merely a matter of individual choices or actions, but is a more fundamental force shaping society.

Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's term for the capitalist mode of production. An axiom is a proposition which cannot be proven true or false and from which one is able to construct a system of rules. Sport offers plenty of examples of axioms—for example, rugby is built on the axiom that the ball can never go forward from the hands, while soccer is built on the axiom that no player (except the goalkeeper) may touch the ball with their hands. There is no justification for these rules; they serve only to construct the necessary conditions for the game. The shape of the pitch, the type of ball used, the number of players on each side, are also axioms for the same reason. In contrast, the offside rule both rugby and soccer have instituted (in different forms of course) is designed to alter the playing conditions of the game as it is already constructed. You could remove the offside rule and it wouldn't substantially alter the game, it would still be rugby or soccer. In Mille Plateaux (1980), translated as A Thousand Plateaus (1987), Deleuze and Guattari utilize this logic to describe the operation of the state as a form of government. Globalization is probably the clearest example of what they mean by axiomatic—e.g., the World Trade Organization enjoins countries to set aside their specific national agenda and abide by rules that facilitate the profit-making of corporations.
