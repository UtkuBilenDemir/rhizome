# Ressentiment

![[Chapter_2#Ressentiment]]

> _*ressenti(e)_ is the past participle of the French verb, ressentir, and _ressentiment_ is the noun form. Nietzsche makes use of_ressentiment_ constantly, in his own singular fashion, to describe the phenomenon whereby an active force is deprived of its normal conditions of existence, where it directs itself inward and turns against itself. "Pushed back and repressed, incarcerated within and finally able to discharge and vent itself only on itself" is a perfect definition of what is meant for something to be_ressenti_ according to Nietzsche's concept of _ressentiment._ In his_Nietzsche et la philosophl e_ (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1970), Deleuze defines _ressentiment_ as the becoming-reactive of force in general: "separated from what it is capable of, the active force does not however cease to exist. Turning against itself, it produces suffering" {p. 147). Hence, Deleuze concludes, with _ressentiment_ a new meaning and depth is created for suffering,_an intimate, internal meaning.
