# Body Without Organs

> [!quote] 
> In the third synthesis, the conjunctive synthesis of consumption, we have seen how the body without organs was in fact an egg, crisscrossed with axes, banded with zones, localized with areas and fields, measured off by gradients, traversed by potentials, marked by thresholds. In this sense, we believe in a biochemistry of schizophrenia (in conjunction with the biochemistry of drugs), that will be progressively more capable of determining the nature of this egg and the distribution of field-gradient-threshold. It is a matter of relationships of intensities through which the subject passes on the body without organs, a process that engages him in becomings, rises and falls, migrations and displacements. R. D. Laing is entirely right in defining the schizophrenic process as a voyage of initiation, a transcendental experience of the loss of the Ego, which causes a subject to remark: "I had existed since the very beginning … from the lowest form of life [the body without organs] to the present time, … 1 was looking … -not looking so much as just feeling-ahead of me was lying the most horrific journey.":" [@deleuze1983, 84]

> But, as she effectively wants to argue, but doesn't quite have the vocabulary to do so, they are very far from naturally occurring - they are engendered but in such a way that they seem to fall back on themselves and smother their origins from view so as to appear unengendered. This is how the body without organs operates. Its chief operation is to 'fall back on' itself and create a smooth plane for desire. This example points to what is perhaps the key feature of the body without organs: it functions as pure presupposition, that is, the thought or idea which thought cannot grasp. It is like our soul, always there, always in need of work, and always unreachable. [[@poster2010|poster2010]]

## BwO is not a feedback loop?

> The body without organs is not a 'feedback loop', as Bard and Soderqvist suggest, because what occurs on the body without organs is not the same thing, and isn't constructed in the same way, as the body without organs itself (Bard and Soderqvist 2002: 1 1 3 ) . What occurs on the body without organs doesn't feed back into it. To continue the example above - if I cross-dress I may be playing with (my) gender, but I'm not thereby altering it, whether on an experiential level or a theo retical level. By the same token, because the body without organs is a virtual entity, Katherine Hayles' complaint that it doesn't pay enough heed to physical constraints is without foundation (Hayles 2001 : 1 54). More to the point, conceptually the body without organs should be understood as our way of coping with physical constraints. It is our means of fabricating a mental position from which to view the condi tions of our everyday life as making sense. ([[@poster2010]], 147)

## Nature of the BwO
The first things to be distributed on the BwO are races, cultures, and their gods [@deleuze1983, 85].
