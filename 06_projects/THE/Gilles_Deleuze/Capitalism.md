# Capitalism
 > Capitalism thrives on two opposite models of nation-states, according to Deleuze. Namely, the tyrannical state such as is found in the third world, and the social-democratic state, such as is found in the first world. It is through these two “models of realization” that capitalism finds a way to spread itself and create, sometimes through violence and coercion, more naked workers and more abstract wealth.
> 
> Deleuze mentions an interesting example of the tendency of nation-states to limit the decoding of fluxes so as to make sure that capital does not become stateless. At the time of the space exploration endeavor which began in the 1950s, enormous sums of money were invested by NASA for spatial projects, to explore the moon for example. President Eisenhower hence reduced NASA’s budget to make sure that these colossal investments would remain on Earth. In other words, he tried to limit the natural tendency of capitalism to deterritorialize, or decode, fluxes of capital.

> According to Deleuze, this is a typical example of the role of the nation-state in a capitalist regime: to reterritorialize fluxes such that capitalism does not decode fluxes _ad infinitum_. The nation-state in a capitalist regime is the regulatory mechanism that tends to maintain the national character of fluxes of people and merchandise.
