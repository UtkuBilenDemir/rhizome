## ðŸ§° The Ethological Toolkit

Ethology explores the relationships between bodies (human and non-human) and their immediate contexts. It focuses on matterâ€™s **affects**, meaning its capacities to affect or be affected. Malins (2004) identifies four key concepts central to an ethological approach:

### 1. **Affect**
- A **pre-personal**, **non-representational** force.
- Operates independently of intentionality.
- Defines a body's **capacity to affect or be affected**.
- Emphasizes **relational potential** rather than fixed attributes.  
  â†’ "Until we can list its capacities, we know nothing about a body." (Deleuze & Guattari 1988, p. 257)
- The basis for interactions, power, and resistance in social encounters.  
  â†’ (Fox & Alldred 2018)

### 2. **Assemblage**
- **Fluid, contingent arrangements** of heterogeneous elements.
- Held together through **temporary relations** (McLeod 2017, p. 16).
- Not a fixed structure, but a **processual configuration**.
- Shapes what bodies can do, based on their relational affects.
- Example: a body enters an assemblage and gains capacities unique to that context.

### 3. **Capacity**
- Emergent **potential for action**, change, or transformation.
- Not intrinsic to a body but dependent on the **assemblages** it enters.
- A body's **capacities define its power** and its potential lines of becoming.
- Core to ethological inquiry: understanding **what bodies can do** in specific configurations.

### 4. **Micropolitics**
- Analyzes how **power operates within assemblages** (Deleuze & Guattari 1988, p. 216).
- Focus on how assemblages **produce, limit, or expand capacities**.
- Two operations:
  - **Territorialisation**: specifies what matter can do (e.g., a metal as 'tool' or 'weapon') (p. 88â€“89).
  - **Deterritorialisation**: **frees matter** from these designations, opening new possibilities (p. 277).
- Enables exploration of **everyday material politics** and **potential for resistance and transformation**.

## ðŸ§­ Summary

Ethology does not treat bodies as static entities, but as **fields of capacity** shaped by interactions and relations. Using the concepts of affect, assemblage, capacity, and micropolitics, we can examine:

- How bodies (human and non-human) are shaped by their environments,
- How power and resistance emerge in material encounters,
- And how everyday interactions offer **sites of transformation and potential**.
