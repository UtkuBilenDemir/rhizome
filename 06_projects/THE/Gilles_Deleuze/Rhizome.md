# Rhizome

## Rhizome cannot be produced by a generative model, it has to be invented, explored

This can be linked to the sixth principle, namely that the rhizome isn't amenable to  any structural or generative model because basically what Deleuze and Guattari are saying is that you can't either prescribe the rhizome into existence or expect to find it naturally occurring. It has to be invented. [@poster2010: 155] .
