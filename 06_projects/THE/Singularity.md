## Deleuze's Singularity

> The upshot in Deleuze’s thought of difference is a world made up of singularities. In fact, although Deleuze speaks of an evanescent materiality that is at its most raw and perhaps not even distinguished into discrete singularities, the very next step in his thinking about this materiality involves speaking of pre-individual singularities or intensities within the evanescent materiality, with the result that for all practical intents and purposes Deleuze’s world starts with a manifold of disparate singularities (Deleuze 1994; Hughes 2009).

> In order to understand the relation between difference and repetition, one may begin by looking at what Deleuze calls singularities. As indicated above, singularities may be described as intensities in the evanescent material world. In the context of a discussion of cadence and rhythm, Deleuze (1994, 21) gives the following characterisation of intensity:  [I]ntensive values act by creating inequalities or incommensurabilities between metrically equivalent periods or spaces. They create distinctive points, privileged instants which always indicate a poly-rhythm. Here again, the unequal is the most positive element.  The point is that the material flux is not homogenous, but is made up of intensities that constitute spatial and temporal inequalities. Repetition can now be considered as the events in which materialinequalities (singularities) continue to exist in difference, or where they are grasped together in the emergence of sensibility, which is another way of existing in difference.
