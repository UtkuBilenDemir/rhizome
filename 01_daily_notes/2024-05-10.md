### Dream
I was seeking and *capturing* seats in a crowded train/ship like a vessel waiting for departure in an underground metro station like huge cave. Lots of interactions with the teen/ young adult girls sitting next to us. Helene goes upstairs to look for another seat, Jonas is also not with me at the moment. A guy in girls' group, he should be in the group but I'm uncertain. We are talking to each other, witty instead of mean, a caring discussion underneath. What was the topic? Was it about the same topic as the conversation with the girls about them demanding Helene's now *free* seat? I cannot recall but after our conversation ends, after a couple of seconds, minutes, I hear his voice:

\- Utku, you are a good person.

The sentence was different, I cannot say the exact one. It is also unclear if I even knew the guy beforehand. I break down in tears. There is a long sequence of hugs, crying, those touches of affection on the face. It was meaningful as if there was something deeper underneath. It felt good.
