### Mediation

Critique is a skill you apply mindfully, it should not be a reaction, especially before you even gave enough time to digest the information. 
### Dream

A night full of dreams, yet I do not remember.
### Appreciation

### Diary

An unproductive day but ends with Gabija. A pretty good one then :)
