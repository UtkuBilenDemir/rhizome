### Mediation
### Dream
My dream woke me up to torture my mind. I remembered that time when that girl with 2 daughters stayed in the same apartment as me. Did I really forget that day? 

### Appreciation
Jonas. Thanks for him.

### Diary
I have been given a chance. For this once, I do not want to mess it up. 

My brain is torturing me. It happened before, it happened continuously. 

I have failed to come up with a solution for it, I am periodically suffering it. I refuse to adjust myself to the tidal crises, I refuse to be a victim in my own mind, I refuse to be miserable.
