### Meditation

I don't dream of a desireless mind or body. Quite the contrary, I wish to burn by desires to go out and connect (to other machines). My mind should be the operation and organisation of the machinery delivering, blocking, steering those desires. I'm the collection of the in- and disjunctive connections.
