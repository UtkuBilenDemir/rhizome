[{"id":"2017","abstract":"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures (German: Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne: Zwölf Vorlesungen) is a 1985 book by Jürgen Habermas, in which the author reconstructs and deals in depth with a number of philosophical approaches to the critique of modern reason and the Enlightenment \"project\" since Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche, including the work of 20th century philosophers Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Cornelius Castoriadis and Niklas Luhmann. The work is regarded as an important contribution to Frankfurt School critical theory. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of world disclosure in modern philosophy.\nAn English translation by Frederick G. Lawrence was published in 1987. A French translation by Christian Bouchindhomme and Rainer Rochlitz was published in 1988.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,22]]},"citation-key":"2017","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,3]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 788716748","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Philosophical_Discourse_of_Modernity&oldid=788716748"},{"id":"2018","abstract":"Artificial\nintelligence, in settings as diverse as politics, commerce, policing and\nwarfare, amplifies longstanding prejudices circumscribing access to the\npolitical public sphere, changing our relations to ourselves and others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,26]]},"citation-key":"2018","container-title":"openDemocracy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,26]]},"language":"en","title":"The politics of artificial intelligence: an interview with Louise Amoore","title-short":"The politics of artificial intelligence","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.opendemocracy.net/digitaliberties/krystian-woznicki-louise-amoore/politics-of-artificial-intelligence-interview-with-l"},{"id":"2018a","abstract":"The nature of machine learning\noperations mean they will actually deepen some humanitarian problematics and introduce new ones of their\nown.

This research gives rise to presenting open-source social networks as a democratic and safer alternative for their users. These social networks shape the Fediverse, the result of the union of the words Federation-Universe, and whose history and evolution we describe. We expose the main postulates of the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) for using this theory to conduct the Fediverse analysis, characterizing it as an Activity System, and thus, investigating the foremost tensions, reasons for change, and results. Among the findings of this analysis are: the preference of users for specific interfaces, the shift in the choice of social networks by users, the suggestions and opinions of the user community, and their influence on the programming development of social networks, promotion, or abandonment of projects by developers and change in the protocols used to connect the networks. We conclude this work by emphasizing that the CHAT allows this type of systemic analysis to be carried out from the critical moments and historical milestones of a system in constant change, such as the Fediverse. Furthermore, the proposal is made that universities are those institutions with prestige and infrastructure that can promote research, criticism, and reflection on the use of social networks for the benefit of users of the social Internet.","citation-key":"2023a","container-title":"Fast Capitalism","DOI":"10.32855/fcapital.2023.002","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4387823725\nS2ID: 5e657d7bd0f622ae979b1c8fec9ec13dc2c7365c","title":"Fediverse’s Evolution from the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},{"id":"2023v","abstract":"İstanbul'daki Gezi Parkı'na Topçu Kışlası'nı yeniden yapmak için başlayan inşaat çalışmalarını protesto etmek amacıyla düzenlenen ve daha sonra Türkiye'nin birçok noktasına yayılan eylemlerin başlamasının üzerinden 11 yıl geçti.

Whereas the two traditional justifications initially grew out of anti-egalitarian premises (about the need for elite wisdom and to protect the elite few against the many), the justification advanced here is grounded in egalitarian premises about the need to protect state institutions from capture by the powerful few and to treat all subjects as political equals.

Political theory of Arendt makes the public sphere which constitutional power of multitude creates a theme. Arendt discovered an opportunity to let public sphere revive and argued in possibility of non-violent revolution. Arendt interested in French Revolution and American Revolution, Russian Revolution and German Revolution, Hungarian uprising and the Spring of Prague as experience of revolution of modern times and the present age. Arendt pays her attention to experience of revolution not experience of war daringly and searches experience of the beginning that is not accompanied with violence. Arendt catches a war phenomenon as a problem of a pre-political stage and is interested in experience of the foundation as a political action.

Contemporary political philosophy-liberalism, communitarianism, and republicanism-disregards history because it is irrelevant to the nature of politics and to what constitutes a political problem. The author argues that this view reduces politics and political philosophy to a vapid academic game that is insensitive to both the essence and practice of politics. He proposes that an indissoluble link between history and politics lies in the notion of representation. Since history represents the past, and the core of democratic politics resides in political representation, the author sees representation as the common ground of history and politics. He welcomes, analyzes, and elaborates all the aestheticist connotations of representation. The history of Machiavellianism demonstrates how influential the impact of history has been on political thought, ironically resulting in the repression of history from philosophical reflection on the nature of politics. Historicist political philosophy is distinguished from its anti-historicist rival in terms of the distinction between historicist compromise and anti-historicist consensus, as seen in the work of Rawls and Rorty. Compromise is shown to be politically creative and open-minded, whereas consensus is conservative and totalitarian. Finally, the author argues that respect is the supreme democratic virtue, and that historicist political philosophy respects \"respect,\" while its anti-historicist rival has no rivals between disrespect and indifference","author":[{"family":"Ankersmit","given":"F.

Boix suggests that democratization is likelier when inequality is low, whereas Acemoglu and Robinson argue that democratization is likelier when inequality is at middling levels. Both assume that democratization is a function of autocratic elites’ fear of the extent to which a future median voter would redistribute under different levels of inequality. Drawing on contractarian political theory, the authors suggest that democratization is instead a function of demands by rising economic groups for protection from the state. This alternative approach suggests that land and income inequality affect democratization differently: Autocracies with equal land distribution are indeed more likely to democratize, but contrary to the conventional wisdom, income inequality is more likely to promote democratization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ansell","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Samuels","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"ansell2010","container-title":"Comparative Political Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0010414010376915","ISSN":"0010-4140, 1552-3829","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1543-1574","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inequality and Democratization: A Contractarian Approach","title-short":"Inequality and Democratization","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414010376915","volume":"43"},{"id":"Ansolabehere2006","author":[{"family":"Ansolabehere","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"Ansolabehere2006","container-title":"The Oxford handbook of political economy","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"title":"Voters, candidates, and parties","type":"chapter"},{"id":"Antonio1983","abstract":"This paper describes the nature of critical theory, its historical development, its connections to sociology and Marxism, and the central debates over its core ideas.","author":[{"family":"Antonio","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"Antonio1983","container-title":"The Sociological Quarterly","ISSN":"00380253, 15338525","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"page":"325-351","title":"The Origin, Development, and Contemporary Status of Critical Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106182","volume":"24"},{"id":"antonioliFluchtlinienPolitischenUber2010","author":[{"family":"Antonioli","given":"Manola"}],"citation-key":"antonioliFluchtlinienPolitischenUber2010","container-title":"Mikropolitik.

Thus, the general objective of this paper raises the problem of the ontological stability of human nature which, within the limits of the technological singularity of mind-reading machines, leads to the loss of autonomy and a reduction in freedom when it comes to human thoughts. In this paradigm, the hypothesis of a future era of technological singularity is prefigured to be a cumulation of factors in which artificial intelligence holds a dominant position in relation to the human agent, in a techno-panoptic system of human supervision, in the form of a new world order of manifestation/imposition of power—that of a “singleton.” The theoretical objective analyzes the phenomenon of “deterritorrialization” (Deleuze & Guattari, 2000, 2005) of the Foucauldian panoptic mechanism (Foucault, 1995, 2003, 2006, 2008)—which is based on the “biopolitical” system of “biopower”—and its “reterritorialization” in the “territory” of the techno-panoptic singularity, where the scenario of a strong AI “singleton” (Bostrom, 2004, 2006), represents the alienation of the Being into a hard technological determinism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,8]]},"author":[{"literal":"Associate Lecturer, Ph.D. Department of Philosophy, Faculty of History and Philosophy, Babeş-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca"},{"family":"Schussler","given":"Aura Elena"}],"citation-key":"associatelecturerph.d.departmentofphilosophyfacultyofhistoryandphilosophybabes-bolyaiuniversitycluj-napoca2020","container-title":"Postmodern Openings","container-title-short":"PO","DOI":"10.18662/po/11.4/239","ISSN":"20680236, 20699387","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"334-346","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Artificial Intelligence and Mind-reading Machines— Towards a Future Techno-Panoptic Singularity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://lumenpublishing.com/journals/index.php/po/article/view/3567","volume":"11"},{"id":"atacGeziParkProtesteNeueMoglichkeiten2013","author":[{"family":"Ataç","given":"Ilker"},{"family":"Dursun","given":"Ayse"}],"citation-key":"atacGeziParkProtesteNeueMoglichkeiten2013","container-title":"Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft","container-title-short":"Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft","ISSN":"2313-5433","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"443-450","title":"Gezi-Park-Proteste: Neue Möglichkeiten, Alte Grenzen?","type":"article-journal","volume":"42"},{"id":"Ataov2007","author":[{"family":"Ataöv","given":"Anlı"}],"citation-key":"Ataov2007","container-title":"Habitat International","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2007.04.002","ISSN":"0197-3975","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"333-344","title":"Democracy to become reality: Participatory planning through action research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397507000215","volume":"31"},{"id":"babic2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            This introductory chapter presents an overview and summary of the focus of this edited volume.

At each session, from now up until the end of the year, I want to give you an example of the way in which something taking place today, or some commonplace or constantly used category, can be represented as a figure or operation of reduction to finitude. As such, each of these things can be encapsulated in terms of the general oppressive vision of finitude.  Today I would like to take the example of Ukraine, the way in which the historic events in Ukraine serve the propagandist consensus that both constitutes and envelops it (at our next sessions I will address two connected notions, which are similarly hegemonic and bask in consensus: the notions of the republic and of secularism – and what I call false invariants: what is assumed to be an invariant, a commonplace of thought, and even a proof of what it is that unites us).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Badiou","given":"Alain"}],"citation-key":"badiouPresentDefaultsUnless2013","container-title":"Versobooks.com","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"title":"\"A present defaults – unless the crowd declares itself\": Alain Badiou on Ukraine, Egypt and finitude","title-short":"A present defaults – unless the crowd declares itself","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/1569-a-present-defaults-unless-the-crowd-declares-itself-alain-badiou-on-ukraine-egypt-and-finitude"},{"id":"bagg2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Random selection for political office—or “sortition”—is increasingly seen as a promising tool for democratic renewal. Critics worry, however, that replacing elected and appointed officials with randomly selected citizens would only exacerbate elite manipulation of political processes. This article argues that sortition\n              can\n              contribute to democratic renewal, but that its genuine promise is obscured by the excessive ambition and misplaced focus of prevailing models. Casting random selection as a route to accurate representation of the popular will, most contemporary proposals require randomly selected citizens to perform legislative tasks, whose open‐endedness grants substantial discretion to elite agenda setters and facilitators. The real democratic promise of sortition‐based reforms, I argue, lies in obstructing elite capture at critical junctures: a narrower task of oversight that creates fewer opportunities for elite manipulation. In such contexts, the benefits of empowering ordinary people—resulting from their immunity to certain distorting influences on career officials—plausibly outweigh the risks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bagg","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"bagg2024","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"American J Political Sci","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12704","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"93-105","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sortition as Anti‐Corruption: Popular Oversight against Elite Capture","title-short":"Sortition as Anti‐Corruption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12704","volume":"68"},{"id":"bahartanyas2017","abstract":"The present study is an exploration of marginalized social identities in the context of social movements. Data have been drawn from a larger project on youth political participation in the 2013 Gezi protests in Turkey. The study’s aim was to understand the ways in which individuals with subordinated minority identities negotiate participation in a heterogeneous social movement in which they are required to act together with majority identity groups. A Labovian analysis of 3 particular cases illustrating hesitations and discomfort about acting together with perceived oppressors in the protests is presented. Each case focuses on disadvantaged social identities, preexisting social hierarchies, and difficulties in welcoming a collective identity shared with other protesters. The analysis indicates that when protest participation requires individual protesters to act together with identity groups that do not recognize their identity as equal in social hierarchies, certain identity threats and dilemmas about participation in the movement emerge. The presence of similar others (i.e., other minority–disadvantaged members of the society), the possibility of developing a supraidentity over preexisting hierarchies and a strong investment in group efficacy appear to be significant in dealing with these dilemmas. A discussion with reference to larger societal dynamics, intersectionality, and narrative analysis is presented.","author":[{"literal":"Bahar Tanyaş"},{"family":"Tanyas","given":"Bahar"}],"citation-key":"bahartanyas2017","container-title":"Qualitative Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/qup0000108","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,27]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2770547560\nS2ID: d114dedd9a97cf6c19afeb88d997266d799ba2a1","title":"Protest Participation and Identity-Related Dilemmas: A Qualitative Inquiry Into the 2013 Gezi Park Protests.","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"bai2022","abstract":"We apply preference modeling and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to finetune language models to act as helpful and harmless assistants.

Finally, we investigate the robustness of RLHF training, and identify a roughly linear relation between the RL reward and the square root of the KL divergence between the policy and its initialization.

We first review related literature to clarify how we see “subjectivities” as emerging through a tangled web of processes and actors. We then offer two case studies exemplifying the emergence of algorithmic subjectivities: one involving computational topic modeling of blogs written by parents with children on the autism spectrum and one involving algorithmic moderation of social media content. Drawing on these case studies, we then articulate a series of qualities that characterizes algorithmic subjectivities. We also compare and contrast these qualities with a number of related concepts from prior literature to articulate how algorithmic subjectivities constitute a novel theoretical contribution, as well as how it offers a focal lens for future empirical investigation and for design. In short, this article points out how certain worlds are being made and/or being made possible via algorithmic systems, and it asks Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) to consider what other worlds might be possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Baumer","given":"Eric P.

As things stand we have so far had little opportunity to explore how new forms of power play out in this context of apparent ?empowerment? and ?democratization?. This article suggests that this is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. To begin to open up this topic this article situates Web 2.0 in the context of the broader transformations that are occurring in new media by drawing on the work of a number of leading writers who, in various ways, consider the implications of software ?sinking? into and ?sorting? aspects of our everyday lives. The article begins with this broader literature before exploring in detail Scott Lash?s notion of ?post-hegemonic power? and more specifically his concept of ?power through the algorithm?. The piece concludes by discussing how this relates to work on Web 2.0 and how this work might be developed in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Beer2009","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444809336551","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,1]]},"page":"985-1002","title":"Power through the algorithm?

Über die Lektüre dieser Beiträge und in Auseinandersetzung mit den Forderungen der Autor/innen sind wir dazu angeregt worden, auf jene Bereiche besonders einzugehen, in denen unserer Ansicht nach weitergearbeitet werden sollte. Dies betrifft Grundlagen partizipativer Forschung wie demokratietheoretische Überlegungen, das Konzept des \"sicheren Raums\", Fragen der Partizipation oder der Ethik, aber auch forschungspraktische Fragen zur Rolle und zu den Aufgaben der verschiedenen Teilnehmenden, zu besonderen methodischen Herangehensweisen bis zur Frage der Gütekriterien, die hier als Rechtfertigungsargumente verstanden werden. Damit soll zu einer breiten Diskussion angeregt werden, die nicht nur auf den engeren Bereich partizipativer Forschung bezogen sein sollte. Da partizipative Methodik manche Fragen nach Erkenntnis und Forschung radikal stellt, birgt sie in sich auch die Chance, auf bisher vernachlässigte Bereiche in der qualitativen Methodik hinzuweisen und ihre weitere Entwicklung anzuregen.\n\nURN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1201302","author":[{"family":"Bergold","given":"Jarg"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"Bergold2012","DOI":"10.17169/fqs-13.1.1801","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,30]]},"language":"de","publisher":"Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research","source":"DataCite","title":"Partizipative Forschungsmethoden: Ein methodischer Ansatz in Bewegung","title-short":"Partizipative Forschungsmethoden","type":"report"},{"id":"besikciDevletlerarasiSomurgeKurdistan2013","author":[{"family":"Beşikçi","given":"İsmail"},{"family":"Önal","given":"Ahmet"}],"citation-key":"besikciDevletlerarasiSomurgeKurdistan2013","ISBN":"978-605-63852-6-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"Turkish","note":"OCLC: 880557208","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Devletlerarası sömürge kürdistan","type":"book"},{"id":"besikciDevletlerarasiSomurgeKurdistan2013a","author":[{"family":"Beşikçi","given":"İsmail"},{"family":"Önal","given":"Ahmet"}],"citation-key":"besikciDevletlerarasiSomurgeKurdistan2013a","ISBN":"978-605-63852-6-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"Turkish","note":"OCLC: 880557208","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Devletlerarası sömürge kürdistan","type":"book"},{"id":"biancaberman2023","abstract":"On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of a war that had been persisting since 2014.

A close analysis reveals that the observational mode used in Maidan (2014), Donbass (2018), and The Kiev Trial (2022) has two primary effects. First, in Donbass and The Kiev Trial, the unfiltered style serves as a contrast to the often farcical and ‘staged’ content, thereby exposing the lies underpinning Soviet presence in Ukraine and the current Russian invasion. Second, in addition to exposing Russian misinformation, Loznitsa’s observational style in Maidan and Donbass facilitates identification with the Ukrainian people by visually and auditorily immersing the viewer in the world on the screen. The article concludes with a discussion of the significance of Loznitsa’s work in shaping the public’s perception of – and continued commitment to – the war in Ukraine.","author":[{"literal":"Bianca Berman"}],"citation-key":"biancaberman2023","container-title":"Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies","DOI":"10.1080/09592318.2023.2220501","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4378980583\nS2ID: f1691eced8f04f50499366e02a660926a6253e2a","page":"1322-1342","title":"Sergei Loznitsa, ethereal documentarian: untangling the Russia-Ukraine war in <i>the Kiev Trial</i>, <i>Donbass</i>, and <i>Maidan</i>","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},{"id":"bianchinJointAttentionCommunicative2014","abstract":"In this article I consider the relevance of Tomasello?s work on social cognition to the theory of communicative action.

As long as the electoral arena does not change and the current electoral regime benefits the ruling parties, the electoral system is not altered. As the electoral arena changes (due to the entry of new voters or a change in voters' preferences), the ruling parties modify the electoral system, depending on the emergence of new parties and the coordinating capacities of the old parties. When the new parties are strong, the old parties shift from plurality/majority to proportional representation if no old party enjoys a dominant position, but they do not do this if there is a dominant old party. When new entrants are weak, a system of nonproportional representation is maintained, regardless of the structure of the old party system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Boix","given":"Carles"}],"citation-key":"boix1999","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am Polit Sci Rev","DOI":"10.2307/2585577","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",9]]},"language":"en","page":"609-624","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Setting the Rules of the Game: The Choice of Electoral Systems in Advanced Democracies","title-short":"Setting the Rules of the Game","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003055400218212/type/journal_article","volume":"93"},{"id":"Boix2007","call-number":"JF51 .O94 2007","citation-key":"Boix2007","collection-title":"The Oxford handbooks of political science","editor":[{"family":"Boix","given":"Carles"},{"family":"Stokes","given":"Susan Carol"}],"event-place":"Oxford ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-927848-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"number-of-pages":"1021","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Oxford handbook of comparative politics","type":"book"},{"id":"bolukbasi2016","abstract":"The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to \"debias\" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolukbasi","given":"Tolga"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kai-Wei"},{"family":"Zou","given":"James"},{"family":"Saligrama","given":"Venkatesh"},{"family":"Kalai","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"bolukbasi2016","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.1607.06520","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?

What enabled this distinctive form of political organization and collective action that has proved so durable and influential? The answer has typically been sought either in the realm of ideas, in the Western tradition of individual rights, or in material change, especially the complex interaction of war, taxes, and economic growth. Common to these strands is the belief that representation resulted from weak ruling powers needing to concede rights to powerful social groups. Boucoyannis argues instead that representative institutions were a product of state strength, specifically the capacity to deliver justice across social groups. Enduring and inclusive representative parliaments formed when rulers could exercise power over the most powerful actors in the land and compel them to serve and, especially, to tax them. The language of rights deemed distinctive to the West emerged in response to more effectively imposed collective obligations, especially on those with most power.\"--","author":[{"family":"Boucoyannis","given":"Deborah"}],"call-number":"JF1063.E85","citation-key":"boucoyannis2021","event-place":"Cambridge, United Kingdom ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-316-67836-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, United Kingdom ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Kings as judges: power, justice, and the origins of parliaments","title-short":"Kings as judges","type":"book"},{"id":"Box1987","author":[{"family":"Box","given":"George EP"},{"family":"Draper","given":"Norman R"}],"citation-key":"Box1987","ISBN":"0-471-81033-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]},"publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","title":"Empirical model-building and response surfaces.","type":"book"},{"id":"Boyd2014","author":[{"family":"Boyd","given":"Danah"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Marwick","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"Boyd2014","container-title":"Data and Discrimination: Collected Essays.

Clay ShirkyYour cell phone provider tracks your location and knows whos with you. Your online and in-store purchasing patterns are recorded, and reveal if you're unemployed, sick, or pregnant. Your e-mails and texts expose your intimate and casual friends. Google knows what youre thinking because it saves your private searches. Facebook can determine your sexual orientation without you ever mentioning it. The powers that surveil us do more than simply store this information. Corporations use surveillance to manipulate not only the news articles and advertisements we each see, but also the prices were offered. Governments use surveillance to discriminate, censor, chill free speech, and put people in danger worldwide. And both sides share this information with each other or, even worse, lose it to cybercriminals in huge data breaches. Much of this is voluntary: we cooperate with corporate surveillance because it promises us convenience, and we submit to government surveillance because it promises us protection. The result is a mass surveillance society of our own making. But have we given up more than weve gained? In Data and Goliath, security expert Bruce Schneier offers another path, one that values both security and privacy. He brings his bestseller up-to-date with a new preface covering the latest developments, and then shows us exactly what we can do to reform government surveillance programs, shake up surveillance-based business models, and protect our individual privacy.

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Burrell","given":"Jenna"}],"citation-key":"Burrell2016","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951715622512","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,6]]},"page":"2053951715622512","title":"How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715622512","volume":"3"},{"id":"burroughs1979","author":[{"family":"Burroughs","given":"William S."}],"citation-key":"burroughs1979","collection-number":"Nr. 2843","collection-title":"Ullstein-Buch","edition":"Ungekürzt Ausg","event-place":"Frankfurt/M","ISBN":"978-3-548-02843-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"number-of-pages":"238","publisher":"Ullstein","publisher-place":"Frankfurt/M","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The Naked Lunch","type":"book"},{"id":"burroughs1992","author":[{"family":"Burroughs","given":"William S."}],"call-number":"PS3552.U75 N3 1991","citation-key":"burroughs1992","edition":"1st evergreen ed","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-8021-3295-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"number-of-pages":"255","publisher":"Grove Weidenfeld","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Naked lunch","type":"book"},{"id":"Büsel2016","author":[{"family":"Büsel","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Degelsegger","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Dietmar"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Isabella"}],"citation-key":"Büsel2016","contributor":[{"family":"Brugner","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Taschwer","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Schmutzhard","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Henriett"}],"event-place":"Wien","genre":"Endbericht","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"publisher":"Zentrum für Soziale Innovation (ZSI)","publisher-place":"Wien","title":"Kopublikationsanalyse Österreich-China","type":"report"},{"id":"Busse2008","author":[{"family":"Busse","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Groizard","given":"José Luis"}],"citation-key":"Busse2008","container-title":"World Economy","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01106.x","ISSN":"1467-9701","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"861-886","title":"Foreign Direct Investment, Regulations and Growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01106.x","volume":"31"},{"id":"butler2018","author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Judith"}],"citation-key":"butler2018","edition":"First Harvard University Press paperback edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts London, England","ISBN":"978-0-674-98398-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"248","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts London, England","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Notes toward a performative theory of assembly","type":"book"},{"id":"Caluya2010","author":[{"family":"Caluya","given":"Gilbert"}],"citation-key":"Caluya2010","container-title":"Social Identities","container-title-short":"Social Identities","DOI":"10.1080/13504630.2010.509565","ISSN":"1350-4630","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]},"page":"621-633","title":"The post-panoptic society?

It holds a value system, gives prominence to those that have been deemed worthy by others, and displays an intention to make the web a space where the exchange of merit is neither impeded nor deformed. By looking back at the origins of PageRank in sociometry and scientometrics, this article identifies the main epistemic properties of a system which measures the authority of documents and relies on the hypertext links exchanged between web pages. One crucial condition of its relevance, described by statistical models underpinning the “wisdom of crowds” thesis, is the assumption that the tool which records internet users’ behaviours is external to the world it measures. Google has established a set of rules to satisfy this condition: separating natural ranking from sponsored links, not manually interfering with the algorithm, encouraging internet users not to act according to the algorithm. But the massification of uses of the web and the multiplication of internet user strategies to be visible to the algorithm make the order that PageRank has imposed on the web increasingly fragile.","author":[{"family":"Cardon","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"Cardon2013","container-title":"Réseaux","ISSN":"0751-7971","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 7814023075","page":"63","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Inside the Mind of PageRank A study of Google’s algorithm","type":"article-journal","volume":"177"},{"id":"cargoValueChallengesParticipatory2008","abstract":"The increasing use of participatory research (PR) approaches to address pressing public health issues reflects PR's potential for bridging gaps between research and practice, addressing social and environmental justice and enabling people to gain control over determinants of their health.

We review the empirical and nonempirical literature in the context of this practice framework to distill the key challenges and added value of PR.

And over the past two decades, these algorithms have usurped humans as the principal arbiters of chess knowledge. Openings, tactics, and strategies are now all authenticated, and often dictated, by engine analysis, leading to new styles of play. This article uses the example of predictive chess engines to conceptualize an emergent temporal interplay between the future and the present. Drawing inspiration from historical metaphors of geology, this article proposes a topographical approach to temporal becoming. In this approach, engine predictions facilitate not preparations for some forecasted future state, but future-reliant calibrations of present activity, where second-by-second algorithmic futures are used to make second-by-second decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheney-Lippold","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"cheney-lippold2024","container-title":"Public Culture","DOI":"10.1215/08992363-11158965","ISSN":"0899-2363, 1527-8018","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"181-207","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engines of the Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/public-culture/article/36/2%20(103)/181/388268/Engines-of-the-FutureOn-Chess-and-Temporal","volume":"36"},{"id":"Cheney2011","abstract":"Marketing and web analytic companies have implemented sophisticated algorithms to observe, analyze, and identify users through large surveillance networks online.

The article will then approach the function of code at the level of the category, arguing that an analysis of coded computer algorithms enables a supplement to Foucauldian thinking around biopolitics and biopower, of what I call soft biopower and soft biopolitics. These new conceptual devices allow us to better understand the workings of biopower at the level of the category, of using computer code, statistics and surveillance to construct categories within populations according to users? surveilled internet history. Finally, the article will think through the nuanced ways that algorithmic inference works as a mode of control, of processes of identification that structure and regulate our lives online within the

How can we talk about the politics of AI while moving beyond mere warnings and easy accusations? This is the first accessible introduction to the political challenges related to AI. Using political philosophy as a unique lens through which to explore key debates in the area, the book shows how various political issues are already impacted by emerging AI technologies: from justice and discrimination to democracy and surveillance. Revealing the inherently political nature of technology, it offers a rich conceptual toolbox that can guide efforts to deal with the challenges raised by what turns out to be not only artificial intelligence but also artificial power.

This paper analyses and discusses some key philosophical assumptions in these debates, in particular assumptions about authorship and language and—our focus—the use of the appearance/reality distinction.

Elsewhere it has been proposed that the functional (selective) advantages associated with various forms of synergistic phenomena have been an important cause of the evolution of complex systems over time. Underlying the many specific steps in the complexification process, a common functional principle has been operative. Furthermore, a major co-determinant of this process has been the parallel evolution of cybernetic processes and systems. This paper will briefly describe this theory (and some of the evidence for it) and will discuss in some detail how the theory relates specifically to the evolution of politics. /// La synergie, y compris la symbiose, a eu, dans l'&#xe9;volution humaine, un r&#xf4;le cr&#xe9;ateur particuli&#xe8;rement significatif.

In particular, democracy is argued to emerge and thrive in countries where liberal or freedom-oriented values (so-called self-expression values) are widespread. Inglehart and Welzel, for instance, report such an effect, mainly drawing inferences from cross-country comparisons. Yet cross-country correlations between self-expression values and democracy could stem from different processes. Reinvestigating this relationship, this article finds no empirical support when employing models accounting for sample-selection bias, country-specific effects and the endogeneity of values to democracy.

In contrast, this study finds indications that a country’s experience with democracy enhances self-expression values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahlum","given":"Sirianne"},{"family":"Knutsen","given":"Carl Henrik"}],"citation-key":"dahlumDemocracyDemandReinvestigating2017","container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"Brit.

That is, we need to ensure that they are an effective means for achieving a legitimate policy goal that are also procedurally fair, open and unbiased. But how can we ensure that algorithmic governance structures are both? This article shares the results of a collective intelligence workshop that addressed exactly this question. The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary group of scholars to consider (a) barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance and (b) the research methods needed to address the nature and impact of specific barriers. An interactive management workshop technique was used to harness the collective intelligence of this multidisciplinary group. This method enabled participants to produce a framework and research agenda for those who are concerned about algorithmic governance. We outline this research agenda below, providing a detailed map of key research themes, questions and methods that our workshop felt ought to be pursued. This builds upon existing work on research agendas for critical algorithm studies in a unique way through the method of collective intelligence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Danaher","given":"John"},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Noone","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Rónán"},{"family":"Behan","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"De Paor","given":"Aisling"},{"family":"Felzmann","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Haklay","given":"Muki"},{"family":"Khoo","given":"Su-Ming"},{"family":"Morison","given":"John"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Maria Helen"},{"family":"O'Brolchain","given":"Niall"},{"family":"Schafer","given":"Burkhard"},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Kalpana"}],"citation-key":"Danaher2017","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951717726554","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,19]]},"page":"2053951717726554","title":"Algorithmic governance: Developing a research agenda through the power of collective intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951717726554","volume":"4"},{"id":"debras2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Objectives\n              To study the associations between artificial sweeteners from all dietary sources (beverages, but also table top sweeteners, dairy products, etc), overall and by molecule (aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose), and risk of cardiovascular diseases (overall, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease).\n            \n            \n              Design\n              Population based prospective cohort study (2009-21).\n            \n            \n              Setting\n              France, primary prevention research.\n            \n            \n              Participants\n              103 388 participants of the web based NutriNet-Santé cohort (mean age 42.2±14.4, 79.8% female, 904 206 person years).

Drawing on the case of 2013 Gezi protests in Turkey, we map the protest waves and identify two mechanisms that mediate the influence of repression on mobilization of dissent. The first mechanism is the perceived nature of the cause of contention. Repression leads to scale shift (McAdam et al., 2008) in the first wave when exercised over those who protest for an issue perceived to be innocent. The second mechanism is the experience of repression. Boundary deactivation among protesters and the resulting continuity in protest activity follow scale shift in the second and third waves as experience of repression transforms perceptions of those that were previously framed as others.

The essays in this collection, written by prominent scholars, offer a new approach to their work. Unique in its emphasis on Guattari, both in conjunction with Deleuze and independently, this volume features an essay by Deleuze himself and includes a comprehensive bibliography of Guattari's and Deleuze's work.The body of work explored here spans three decades and cuts across the lines of philosophy, political theory, geography, literature, aesthetics, and even the applied sciences. Readers unfamiliar with Deleuze and Guattari will gain a broad sense of their work from these pages; specialists will discover new and different methods of understanding the contributions of these writers.The essays map out a set of applications that, rather than explain Deleuze and Guattari, aim to extend and reinvent their thought in new and \"real life\" domains, from cinema to the Gulf War, from quantum mechanics to the L.A. riots, and from Israel's deportation of Palestinians to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's masochism. Overall, the collection demonstrates the wide range of potential applications of Deleuze's and Guattari's theories and expands current readings of their work.","author":[{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Heller","given":"Kevin Jon"}],"citation-key":"Deleuze1998","ISBN":"978-0-8166-3028-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"324","publisher":"U of Minnesota Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Deleuze & Guattari: New Mappings in Politics, Philosophy, and Culture","title-short":"Deleuze & Guattari","type":"book"},{"id":"deleuze2019","author":[{"family":"Deleuze","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Guattari","given":"Félix"}],"citation-key":"deleuze2019","collection-number":"1","collection-title":"Kapitalismus und Schizophrenie / Gilles Deleuze; Félix Guattari.

Second, it develops expectations on how such politicisation will take place: the distinctive features of populism (the intensity of populist discourse, the relative weight of anti-elitism and people-centrism, and a transnational understanding of the ‘people’ or the ‘elite’) will have an impact on how foreign policy is politicised. The empirical analysis focuses on selected public speeches and tweets by two populist leaders from the Global South: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Narendra Modi. The analysis reveals huge differences: the more populist Erdoğan emphasises anti-elitism and extensively resorts to the politicisation of Turkish foreign policy by constructing foreign threats. Modi is less populist and his discourse emphasises people-centrism; as expected, he only marginally politicises foreign policy, highlighting the greatness of the Indian nation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Destradi","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Plagemann","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Taş","given":"Hakkı"}],"citation-key":"destradi2022","container-title":"The British Journal of Politics and International Relations","container-title-short":"The British Journal of Politics and International Relations","DOI":"10.1177/13691481221075944","ISSN":"1369-1481, 1467-856X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","page":"475-492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Populism and the politicisation of foreign policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13691481221075944","volume":"24"},{"id":"devlin2018","abstract":"We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

Sie formulieren die These, dass sich bereits zu Beginn der Menschheitsgeschichte mit der Selbstbehauptung des Subjekts gegenüber einer bedrohlichen Natur eine instrumentelle Vernunft durchgesetzt habe, die sich als Herrschaft über innere und äußere Natur befestigte. Ausgehend von diesem „Herrschaftscharakter“ der Vernunft beobachten Horkheimer und Adorno einen Aufschwung der Mythologie, die „Rückkehr der aufgeklärten Zivilisation zur Barbarei in der Wirklichkeit“, welche sich in der gegenwärtigen Gesellschaft auf unterschiedliche Weise manifestiere. Diese „Verschlingung von Mythos und Aufklärung“ (Habermas) habe nicht einen Befreiungs-, sondern einen universellen Selbstzerstörungsprozess der Aufklärung in Gang gesetzt.

Contemporary work on voting emphasizes the lack of knowledge and time invested in politics by most voters. Voters take their cues for voting from groups with which they feel allegiance for reasons unrelated to their social or political concerns. Citizens, too often subject to manipulation, support candidates who will act against their real interests. We think of our elected representatives as simply supporting the views of voters and interest groups who are responsible for their election instead of actively engaging voters. Disch argues against both views. She contends that voter participation is not as limited as many argue and that representation plays a more active role in organizing and engaging voters.

In real-world software development, humans usually tackle complex tasks through collaborative teamwork, a strategy that significantly controls development complexity and enhances software quality. Inspired by this, we present a self-collaboration framework for code generation employing LLMs, exemplified by ChatGPT. Specifically, through role instructions, 1) Multiple LLMs act as distinct ``experts'', each responsible for a specific subtask within a complex task; 2) Specify the way to collaborate and interact, so that different roles form a virtual team to facilitate each other's work, ultimately the virtual team addresses code generation tasks collaboratively without the need for human intervention. To effectively organize and manage this virtual team, we incorporate software-development methodology into the framework. Thus, we assemble an elementary team consisting of three ChatGPT roles (i.e., analyst, coder, and tester) responsible for software development's analysis, coding, and testing stages.

The term “glocal” has been used as the simultaneous occurrence of both universalizing and particularizing trends in contemporary socio-political, and socio-economic systems. Since 1990, many scholars argued that the welfare policies of urbanism are superseded by the “neo-urban politics”. This process ended up with a new focus on local economy and competitiveness that is empowered by the process of glocalisation. As far the as urban transformation/renewal/revitalization is concerned it seems impossible to isolate the process from the global market, city branding and the rising new middle class. In this article the term glocalization will be utilized in the context of İstanbul and it will be employed for having a better understanding the two general problematics: Firstly, how does local politics and competitive processes work under the pressure of globalization (i.e special attractions, branding, organizing international events); secondly how urban politics and local actors get influenced by it. The specific focus in this research will be the case of Yeldeğirmeni in Kadıköy which seems to be known as a positive and participatory model for revitalization in Asian side of İstanbul. However according to the findings of this study %90 percent of the people who reside here about 35- 40 years neighborhood have negative responses to it. The results of this study will be discussed in the context of new urban politics and its glocal consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Durgun","given":"Sezgi"}],"citation-key":"durgun2021","container-title":"Anadolu Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi","DOI":"10.18037/ausbd.1001646","ISSN":"2667-8683","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,27]]},"page":"709-724","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urban Localities under Glocal Dynamics: The Case of Yeldeğirmeni","title-short":"Urban Localities under Glocal Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dergipark.org.tr/tr/doi/10.18037/ausbd.1001646","volume":"21"},{"id":"ebruerdonmez2014","author":[{"literal":"Ebru Erdonmez"},{"family":"Erdonmez","given":"Ebru"}],"citation-key":"ebruerdonmez2014","DOI":"10.5593/sgemsocial2014/b41/s15.116","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2312626753\nS2ID: 540d42f3785d5a53bd4b728b7ed1e1ddd21c03da","title":"SOCIAL MOVEMENT DERIVED PUBLIC SPACES: A FOCUS ON GEZI PROTEST","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"Ecker2017","author":[{"family":"Ecker","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Thomas M"}],"citation-key":"Ecker2017","container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"British Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0007-1234","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-20","title":"Coalition Bargaining Duration in Multiparty Democracies","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"elinesevers2016","abstract":"This article critically reviews the extant literature on social group representation and clarifies the advantages of intersectionality theory for studying political representation.

The issue in this first part of Difference and Repetition consists of the critique of traditional metaphysics as a system of representation. Traditional metaphysics tries to represent existing things, instead of problemtising their genesis. It presents them by making them organized and suitable for the human eye. Traditional philosophy does this by subordinating difference to identity. Ultimately, for philosophy, difference is merely a means to guarantee the structure of the representational system based on identity and on harmony. However, Deleuze’s philosophy is a system of thought about the origin of the existence of things. Here, difference becomes the constitutive element. At this point, our aim will be to reveal the general structure of various representational systems. Our first subject will be Aristotle’s Organic Representational system, in which the limit of beings is well determined. After this system, we will move on to the infinite representational system, where the purpose of the limit is not the restriction but to enable the finite to pass beyond itself. According to Deleuze, the Philosophical systems that are similar to the latter are exemplified by Hegel and Leibniz. Essentially, in this section, Deleuze shows himself to be on the side of Leibniz and criticizes Hegelian dialectics. This criticism here shows that individual and unconscious creation is the basic question at the core of Deleuze’s system, which is based on the problem of origin. Deleuze’s aim is to build a system of philosophy based on Leibnizian philosophy, purified from old metaphysics defects and a reinterpretation of Kantian experience.","author":[{"literal":"Erdem Baykal"}],"citation-key":"erdembaykal2024","container-title":"Bingöl Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dergisi","DOI":"10.29029/busbed.1391701","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"note":"S2ID: 3fe16e19eedcc468a99afb1b5fe7b09ea805f200","title":"DELEUZE AND INFINITE REPRESENTATION: CONTRADICTION VERSUS SUFFICIENT REASON","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"ettinger2019","abstract":"Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models.

I subsequently conceptualize digital governance as encompassing subjection as well as resistance, and I cast the two in relational perspective by making use of the concepts ?affordance? and ?assemblage? in conjunction with multiple subjectivities and Foucault's view of power as productive as well as his view of resistance as an ?antagonism of strategies? in his late scholarship on resistance, ethics, and subjectivity. I offer examples of salient modes of what I call ?productive? resistance (as opposed to resistance by way of avoidance, disruption or obfuscation), and from a Foucauldian perspective I explain how each mode targets and subverts technologies of repressive power to produce new elements of the digital environment and construct new truths. I conclude by recognizing the agency embodied in resistance as an end in itself, but I also consider that modes of productive resistance can have extrinsic value as they affect the fluid interaction among elements of the digital environment, potentially disrupting the presumed structure of dominance and dependence, and opening our conceptualization of algorithmic life to hopeful possibilities for change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ettlinger","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"ettlinger2018","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951718771399","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"page":"2053951718771399","title":"Algorithmic affordances for productive resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951718771399","volume":"5"},{"id":"EU-Com.2015","author":[{"literal":"EU-Commission"}],"citation-key":"EU-Com.2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Factsheet on Investor-State Dispute Settlement","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"eurobarometerSpecialEurobarometer3412010","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"literal":"Eurobarometer"}],"citation-key":"eurobarometerSpecialEurobarometer3412010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"title":"Special Eurobarometer 341: Biotechnology - Data Europa EU","type":"webpage","URL":"https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/s755_73_1_ebs341?locale=en"},{"id":"europeancommission.directorategeneralforresearchandinnovation.2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"literal":"European Commission.

The article tackles this issue by exploring how welfare regulations and redistribution policies can be rethought in the age of digital capitalism. It focuses on the history and enduring crisis of social citizenship rights in their connection with technological changes, in order to draw a comparison between the industrial and the digital scenario. The first section addresses the link between the Industrial Revolution and the genesis of social rights. It describes the latter as a legal ‘machine’ designed to offset the imbalances produced by the technological movement of industrialization. The second and third sections introduce the notion of ‘industrial citizenship’ to describe the architecture of social rights in mature industrial societies and to contend that European systems of welfare are still largely modeled on an industrial standard. The fourth part investigates the impact of the Digital Revolution on this model of social citizenship. It identifies debates on basic income as a major trajectory for redesigning welfare regulations in a post-industrial era, and the digital user as a crucial emerging subject of rights. The final part explores how digital users could be entitled to social rights as data suppliers. To this end, it introduces the idea of ‘digital-social rights’ resulting from the incorporation of welfare and redistribution principles into emerging digital rights. Hence, it proposes a legal-political framework for the redistribution of the revenues generated by data in the form of a ‘digital basic income’ for citizens of cyberspace.","author":[{"literal":"Federico Tomasello"},{"literal":"Federico Tomasello"}],"citation-key":"federicotomasello2022","container-title":"Theory and Society","DOI":"10.1007/s11186-022-09480-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,3]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4281621320","PMID":"35676929","title":"From industrial to digital citizenship: rethinking social rights in cyberspace","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"Feenberg1995","type":"book","abstract":"Literaturverz.

An idea advanced mainly by democratic and postpositivist theorists is increasingly becoming a practical concern. Criticizing conventional conceptions of science and expertise, theorists advocating participatory democracy argue that the conventional model of professionalism based on a practitioner-client hierarchy must give way to a more collaborative method of inquiry. While such arguments have largely remained in the domain of utopian speculation, recent experiences with a number of 'wicked' policy problems have begun to suggest the viability, if not the necessity, of participatory research methods. Through two case illustrations of a wicked problem, the socalled 'Nimby Syndrome,' the essay seek to demonstrate that collaborative citizen-expert inquiry may well hold the key to solving a specific category of contemporary policy problems. The article concludes with some observations on the possibilities of bringing participatory research more fully into mainstream policy science.","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"Fischer1993","container-title":"Policy Sciences","ISSN":"00322687, 15730891","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"page":"165-187","title":"Citizen Participation and the Democratization of Policy Expertise: From Theoretical Inquiry to Practical Cases","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4532286","volume":"26"},{"id":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematische","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Ilse"}],"citation-key":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematische","language":"de","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Einfu¨hrung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischea","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Ilse"}],"citation-key":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischea","language":"de","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Einfu¨hrung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischeb","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Ilse"}],"citation-key":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischeb","language":"de","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Einfu¨hrung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischec","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Ilse"}],"citation-key":"fischerEinfuHrungMathematischec","language":"de","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Einfu¨hrung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"fischerLernbuchLineareAlgebra2017","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Gerd"}],"citation-key":"fischerLernbuchLineareAlgebra2017","collection-title":"Lehrbuch","contributor":[{"family":"Quiring","given":"Florian"}],"edition":"3., verbesserte und ergänzte Auflage","event-place":"Wiesbaden","ISBN":"978-3-658-18190-1 978-3-658-18191-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"ger","note":"OCLC: 1001427902","number-of-pages":"478","publisher":"Springer-Spektrum","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Lernbuch lineare Algebra und analytische Geometrie: das Wichtigste ausführlich für das Lehramts- und Bachelorstudium","title-short":"Lernbuch lineare Algebra und analytische Geometrie","type":"book"},{"id":"fischerSwedishMediaDebate","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Klara"},{"family":"Wennström","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Ågren","given":"Mia"}],"citation-key":"fischerSwedishMediaDebate","language":"en","page":"56","source":"Zotero","title":"The Swedish Media Debate on GMO 1994-2017","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"flachRevolutionRojavaFrauenbewegung2015","author":[{"family":"Flach","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Ayboğa","given":"Ercan"},{"family":"Knapp","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"flachRevolutionRojavaFrauenbewegung2015","collection-title":"Tatort Kurdistan","edition":"2., verb.

The difference is not just semantic but also logical: relations of representative agency are dyadic (\n              x\n              represents\n              y\n              ), while portrayals are triadic (\n              x\n              represents\n              y\n              as\n              z\n              ). I exploit this insight to disambiguate constructivism and to improve our theoretical vocabulary for analyzing political representation. I amend Saward’s claims-based approach on three points, introducing the “characterization” to correctly identify the elements of representational claims; explaining the “referent” in pragmatic, not metaphysical terms; and differentiating multiple forms of representational activity. This enables me to clarify how the represented can be\n              both\n              prior to representation\n              and\n              constituted by it, and to recover Pitkin’s idea that representatives ought to be “responsive” to the represented. These points are pertinent to debates about the role of representatives, the nature of representative democracy, and the dynamics of revolutionary movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fossen","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"fossen2019","container-title":"American Political Science

First, this paper re-reads Foucault's Discipline and Punish in the light of his analysis of the art of liberal government that is advanced through the course of these lectures. It is argued that the Panopticon is not just an architecture of power centred on discipline and normalization, as is commonly understood, but a normative model of the relation of the state to the market which, for Foucault, is ?the very formula of liberal government?. Second, the limits of panopticism, and by extension liberal governance, are explored through analysis of Gilles Deleuze's account of the shift from disciplinary to ?control? societies, and Zygmunt Bauman's writings on individualization and the ?Synopticon?. In response to Deleuze and Bauman, the final section of this paper returns to Foucault's lectures on biopolitics to argue that contemporary capitalist society is characterized not simply by the decline of state powers (the control society) or the passing down of responsibilities from the state to the individual (the individualization thesis), but by the neoliberal marketization of the state and its institutions; a development which is underpinned by a specific form of governmentality. In conclusion, a four-fold typology of surveillance is advanced: surveillance as discipline, as control, as interactivity, and as a mechanism for promoting competition. It is argued that while these types of surveillance are not mutually exclusive, they are underpinned by different governmentalities that can be used to address different aspects of the relationship between the state and the market, and with this the social and cultural logics of contemporary forms of market capitalism more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Gane","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"Gane2012","container-title":"The Sociological Review","container-title-short":"The Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02126.x","ISSN":"0038-0261","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,1]]},"page":"611-634","title":"The Governmentalities of Neoliberalism: Panopticism, Post-Panopticism and beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2012.02126.x","volume":"60"},{"id":"gane2014","author":[{"family":"Gane","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"gane2014","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"3-27","title":"The emergence of neoliberalism: Thinking through and beyond Michel Foucault’s lectures on biopolitics","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},{"id":"Gane2017","author":[{"family":"Gane","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Venn","given":"Couze"},{"family":"Hand","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"Gane2017","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"7-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"349-358","title":"Ubiquitous surveillance: interview with Katherine Hayles","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},{"id":"Gaukrodger2012","abstract":"Governments are facing an increasing number of arbitration claims by foreign investors relating to important public policies or seeking substantial damages, and many governments are taking a greater joint interest in how such cases are resolved in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).

This chapter argues that French political philosophy points to an even more fundamental role for power and representation in the construction (or the ‘constitution’) of society and the self-image of its members. It focuses on a key argument of political theorist, Claude Lefort, who maintained that the specificity of a society is determined by the way power is organized and symbolically represented in that society. On this account, the importance of political representation goes far beyond the formation of opinions and the process of collective decision making. The organization and representation of power is instead seen as a key determinant of society’s self-understanding and of the way citizens within that society understand themselves and their mutual relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Geenens","given":"Raf"}],"citation-key":"geenens2019","container-author":[{"family":"Geenens","given":"Raf"}],"container-title":"The Constructivist Turn in Political Representation","DOI":"10.3366/edinburgh/9781474442602.003.0006","ISBN":"978-1-4744-4260-2 978-1-4744-5986-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-103","publisher":"Edinburgh University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Political representation: the view from France","title-short":"Political representation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/edinburgh-scholarship-online/book/31152/chapter/264189313"},{"id":"Gehring2017","author":[{"family":"Gehring","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"Gehring2017","container-title":"Foucault Studies","container-title-short":"Foucault Studies","ISSN":"1832-5203","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"46-62","title":"The Inverted Eye.

However, their understanding of democracy has never been questioned. It is crucial to undertake such an analysis in order to fullyrecognize the critical potential of research  employing a participatory approach. Looking at participatory research we raise the following questions: Who are the real “stars” within participatory research and why? Who is participating and for what reasons, to what extent of time and at which phase of the research process? We argue that participatory research can only reach its full potential if one applies for example insights of democracy theory to it. In our approach we reject conceptions of democracy that are based on one-sided majorities and polarizations of power. We see the essential indicator for participatory research of high quality in its capability to question power relations and power distributions within the socialarena. This implies that participatory research maintains a critical watch on the reciprocity between researchers and research participants.. It further calls for a transparent method and the possibility for different parties to contribute in order to render the research productive for everybody involved.

The third part provides some insights into particular aspects of digital surveillance through three examples: algorithmic video surveillance (in which closed circuit television systems are linked to software for the recognition of movement or identity); the increasingly prevalent practices of digital prioritization in transport and communications; and the medical surveillance of populations, wherein databases are created for increasingly mixed state and commercial medical purposes.

That study employed primarily individual and group interviews to assess benefits and limitations of self‐help groups. SETTINGS: Four breast cancer self‐help groups in Ontario communities provided the core involvement in the participatory research project. RESULTS: The values and practices of mainstream academic research often conflict with those of research emphasizing participation and control of communities under study, leading to a variety of challenges for the latter approaches. Practical constraints faced by many community groups have important implications for participatory research approaches.

The park dates back to the 1940s and is well-known as public promenade. The modest demonstration was triggered by a government decision to reconstruct a former Ottoman Artillery Barracks. Within a few days, it developed into a violent uprising on an unprecedented scale lasting almost an entire month. Crowds not only gathered in Istanbul but also in many other Turkish cities such as the capital, Ankara. International media broadcast the protests live from Taksim Square turning the Gezi Park protest into an international phenomenon. Today the Park has become a reference point in Turkish politics where almost every issue is linked to the ‘spirit of Gezi’. It made a modest protest over an inner city promenade into a vivid symbol of political opposition.

From a public interest view, we would expect “effective” regulation to ex ante mitigate agency conflicts between corporate insiders and outsiders, and prevent corporate misbehavior from occurring or quickly rectify transgressions. However, regulators are also self-interested and may be captured, uninformed, or ideological, and become less effective as a result. We develop a historical time series of corporate (accounting) scandals and (accounting) regulations for a panel of 26 countries from 1800 to 2015. An analysis of the lead-lag relations at both the global and individual country level yields the following insights: (i) Corporate scandals are an antecedent to regulation over long stretches of time, suggesting that regulators are typically less flexible and informed than firms. (ii) Regulation is positively related to the incidence of future scandals, suggesting that regulators are not fully effective, that explicit rules are required to identify scandalous corporate actions, or that new regulations have unintended consequences. (iii) There exist systematic differences in these lead-lag relations across countries and over time suggesting that the effectiveness of regulation is shaped by fundamental country characteristics like market development and legal tradition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hail","given":"Luzi"},{"family":"Tahoun","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Clare"}],"citation-key":"Hail2017","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,15]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2961535","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Corporate Scandals and Regulation","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2961535"},{"id":"Hajian2016","author":[{"family":"Hajian","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Bonchi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Castillo","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"Hajian2016","event-title":"Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining","ISBN":"1-4503-4232-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"2125-2126","publisher":"ACM","title":"Algorithmic bias: From discrimination discovery to fairness-aware data mining","type":"paper-conference"},{"id":"Hall1981","author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"B.L."}],"citation-key":"Hall1981","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"publisher":"publisher not identified","title":"Participatory Research, Popular Knowledge and Power: A Personal Reflection","type":"book","URL":"https://books.google.at/books?id=oPE8GwAACAAJ"},{"id":"Hall1985","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Budd"}],"citation-key":"Hall1985","container-title":"International Review of Education","DOI":"10.1007/BF00597906","ISSN":"0020-8566, 1573-0638","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"language":"en","page":"289-299","source":"CrossRef","title":"Research, commitment and action: The role of participatory research","title-short":"Research, commitment and action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00597906","volume":"30"},{"id":"Hall1992","abstract":"This article documents the development of the libratory stream of participatory research as experienced through the activities and connections of one of the key figures in the early development and dissemination of these ideas.

Yet today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas .Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Whereas most of the existing literature on party change deals with party systems, the focus here is on individual parties. Whereas much of the literature views parties as responding more or less gradually to socioeconomic change, change is here regarded as a discontinuous outcome of specific party decisions linked to party goals. This approach is placed in the literature by reviewing extant theories of party change. Our theory itself is initially advanced in a discursive section which suggests that change does not `just happen', but instead results from leadership change, a change of dominant faction within the party, and/or an external stimulus for change. The article then presents a more formal exposition of this theory, consisting of definitions, assumptions, and a series of testable propositions. It concludes with illustrative examples of this theoretical framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Harmel","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Janda","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"harmel1994","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Politics","container-title-short":"Journal of Theoretical Politics","DOI":"10.1177/0951692894006003001","ISSN":"0951-6298, 1460-3667","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",7]]},"language":"en","page":"259-287","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Integrated Theory of Party Goals and Party Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0951692894006003001","volume":"6"},{"id":"hartimo2006","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartimo","given":"Mirja"}],"citation-key":"hartimo2006","container-title":"History and Philosophy of Logic","container-title-short":"History and Philosophy of Logic","DOI":"10.1080/01445340600619663","ISSN":"0144-5340, 1464-5149","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11]]},"language":"en","page":"319-337","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mathematical roots of phenomenology: Husserl and the concept of number","title-short":"Mathematical roots of phenomenology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01445340600619663","volume":"27"},{"id":"haslingerKomplexeAnalysisUnd","author":[{"family":"Haslinger","given":"Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"haslingerKomplexeAnalysisUnd","language":"de","page":"147","source":"Zotero","title":"Komplexe Analysis I und II","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"hassan2017","author":[{"family":"Hassan","given":"Samer"},{"family":"De Filippi","given":"Primavera"}],"citation-key":"hassan2017","container-title":"Field Actions Science Reports.

Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hausberg","given":"J.

By making these unrepresentative claims, they declined any representative mandate, asserting their freedom from any instituted influence. However, by claiming to speak only for themselves, they also selected the aspects of their identity they performed. This allowed them to embody the people sharing this identity, recalling the medieval\n              repraesentatio identitatis\n              , but in a way adjusted to today’s greater personalization of politics.

Some tribunals have attempted to employ proportionality analysis in their determination of claims, but their reasoning has been methodologically problematic and characterized by a stringent standard of review, diverging from the approach of other international and supranational fora hearing disputes concerning the exercise of public power affecting individual rights and interests. Investment tribunals should be more deferential in performing proportionality analysis, mindful of host state authorities’ greater democratic legitimacy and proximity to host state communities, and tribunals’ comparatively weak institutional capacity. Such an approach would entail greater deference to host states in evaluating the legitimacy of a measure’s objective, the measure’s suitability and necessity, and the ultimate balance between the interests of the host state and of the investor. An appropriately deferential use of proportionality analysis is a more coherent approach to indirect expropriation that provides greater space for host states to take measures in the public interest, yet provides sufficient scrutiny to control misuse of public power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Henckels","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"Henckels2012","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,22]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2089477","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Indirect Expropriation and the Right to Regulate: Revisiting Proportionality Analysis and the Standard of Review in Investor-State Arbitration","title-short":"Indirect Expropriation and the Right to Regulate","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2089477"},{"id":"Heron1996","author":[{"family":"Heron","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"Heron1996","ISBN":"978-0-8039-7684-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Co-Operative Inquiry: Research Into the Human Condition","type":"book","URL":"https://books.google.at/books?id=yT1y6bdKI24C"},{"id":"hildebrandt2011","author":[{"family":"Hildebrandt","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Rouvroy","given":"Antoinette"}],"citation-key":"hildebrandt2011","ISBN":"1-136-80767-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"publisher":"Routledge","title":"The Philosophy of Law Meets the Philosophy of Technology","type":"book"},{"id":"Hildebrandt2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hildebrandt","given":"Mireille"}],"citation-key":"Hildebrandt2013","DOI":"10.4324/9780203427644","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-203-42764-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,3]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Crossref","title":"Privacy, Due Process and the Computational Turn: The Philosophy of Law Meets the Philosophy of Technology","title-short":"Privacy, Due Process and the Computational Turn","type":"book","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203427644"},{"id":"hildebrandt2016","author":[{"family":"Hildebrandt","given":"Mireille"}],"citation-key":"hildebrandt2016","container-title":"The Art of Ethics in the Information Society","container-title-short":"The Art of Ethics in the Information Society","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"The New Imbroglio—living with machine algorithms","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"hildebrandtChallengesAmbientLaw2010","author":[{"family":"Hildebrandt","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Koops","given":"Bert‐Jaap"}],"citation-key":"hildebrandtChallengesAmbientLaw2010","container-title":"The Modern Law Review","container-title-short":"The Modern Law Review","ISSN":"0026-7961","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"428-460","title":"The challenges of ambient law and legal protection in the profiling era","type":"article-journal","volume":"73"},{"id":"Hoare1962","author":[{"family":"Hoare","given":"Charles AR"}],"citation-key":"Hoare1962","container-title":"The Computer Journal","container-title-short":"The Computer Journal","ISSN":"0010-4620","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1962"]]},"page":"10-16","title":"Quicksort","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},{"id":"hoffmann2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Clemens"},{"family":"Matin","given":"Kamran"}],"citation-key":"hoffmann2021","container-title":"Geopolitics","container-title-short":"Geopolitics","DOI":"10.1080/14650045.2021.1924944","ISSN":"1465-0045, 1557-3028","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,5]]},"language":"en","page":"967-972","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beyond Anarchy and Capital?

Studies on Internet governance rely on contradictory notions of governance. The common understanding of governance as some form of deliberate steering or regulation clashes with equally common definitions of Internet governance as distributed modes of ordering. Drawing on controversies in the broader field of governance and regulation studies, we propose to resolve this conceptual conundrum by grounding governance in mundane activities of coordination. We define governance as reflexive coordination – focusing on those ‘critical moments’, when routine activities become problematic and need to be revised, thus, when regular coordination itself requires coordination. Regulation, in turn, can be understood as targeted public or private interventions aiming to influence the behaviour of others. With this distinction between governance and regulation, we offer a conceptual framework for empirical studies of doing Internet governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Jeanette"},{"family":"Katzenbach","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Gollatz","given":"Kirsten"}],"citation-key":"hofmann2017","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444816639975","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1406-1423","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Between coordination and regulation: Finding the governance in Internet governance","title-short":"Between coordination and regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444816639975","volume":"19"},{"id":"holland1999","author":[{"family":"Holland","given":"Eugene W."},{"family":"Deleuze","given":"Gilles"}],"call-number":"RC455 .D42213 1999","citation-key":"holland1999","event-place":"London ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-415-11318-2 978-0-415-11319-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"161","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus: introduction to schizoanalysis","title-short":"Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus","type":"book"},{"id":"Hollifield2012","author":[{"family":"Hollifield","given":"James F"}],"citation-key":"Hollifield2012","event-title":"IPSA’s 22nd World Congress of Political Science, Reshaping Power, Shifting Boundaries, Madrid","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"1-39","title":"Why do states risk migration","type":"paper-conference"},{"id":"honig2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Honig","given":"Bonnie"}],"citation-key":"honig2017","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt1xhr6n9","ISBN":"978-0-8232-7643-1 978-0-8232-7641-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,1]]},"publisher":"Fordham University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Public Things: Democracy in Disrepair","title-short":"Public Things","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt1xhr6n9"},{"id":"Horkheimer2017","author":[{"family":"Horkheimer","given":"Max"},{"family":"Adorno","given":"Theodor W."}],"citation-key":"Horkheimer2017","collection-number":"7404","collection-title":"Fischer-Taschenbücher Fischer Wissenschaft","edition":"23.

Specifically, we train Kosmos-1 from scratch on web-scale multimodal corpora, including arbitrarily interleaved text and images, image-caption pairs, and text data. We evaluate various settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and multimodal chain-of-thought prompting, on a wide range of tasks without any gradient updates or finetuning. Experimental results show that Kosmos-1 achieves impressive performance on (i) language understanding, generation, and even OCR-free NLP (directly fed with document images), (ii) perception-language tasks, including multimodal dialogue, image captioning, visual question answering, and (iii) vision tasks, such as image recognition with descriptions (specifying classification via text instructions). We also show that MLLMs can benefit from cross-modal transfer, i.e., transfer knowledge from language to multimodal, and from multimodal to language. In addition, we introduce a dataset of Raven IQ test, which diagnoses the nonverbal reasoning capability of MLLMs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Shaohan"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Li"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenhui"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Yaru"},{"family":"Singhal","given":"Saksham"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Shuming"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Tengchao"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Owais Khan"},{"family":"Patra","given":"Barun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Kriti"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Zewen"},{"family":"Bjorck","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Vishrav"},{"family":"Som","given":"Subhojit"},{"family":"Song","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Furu"}],"citation-key":"huang2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2302.14045","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Language Is Not All You Need: Aligning Perception with Language Models","title-short":"Language Is Not All You Need","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14045","version":"2"},{"id":"huckleSocialismBlockchain2016","author":[{"family":"Huckle","given":"Steve"},{"family":"White","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"huckleSocialismBlockchain2016","container-title":"Future Internet","container-title-short":"Future Internet","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"49","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Socialism and the Blockchain","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},{"id":"hudsonCurrentIssuesPrimary1975","author":[{"family":"Hudson","given":"J.

The Fediverse includes a growing number of decentralized social networks, such as Pleroma or Mastodon, that share the same subscription protocol (ActivityPub). Each of these decentralized social networks is composed of independent instances that are run by different administrators. Users, however, can interact with other users across the Fediverse regardless of the instance they are signed up to. The growing user base of the Fediverse creates key challenges for the administrators, who may experience a growing burden. In this paper, we explore how large that overhead is, and whether there are solutions to alleviate the burden. We study the overhead of moderation on the administrators. We observe a diversity of administrator strategies, with evidence that administrators on larger instances struggle to find sufficient resources.

The way food is consumed and produced affects the human well-being as well as the environment. Avoiding food losses and adopting a balanced healthy diet is also an important step towards sustain ability. Promoting dietary standards and monitoring their adoption is a potentially important policy tool for mitigating environmental impacts of food production as well as monitoring food security and nutrition. There is relatively little research to measure nutritional adequacy of food intake according to dietary standards, and to explore the relationship with health outcomes. In this study we choose the well-established WHO global-level dietary recommendations as a reference to quantify nutritional adequacy by developing an energy and macronutrient intake index (ENI), and to assess its relation to indicators of hunger and undernutrition. We find strong negative association between nutritional adequacy of dietary intake and prevalence of undernutrition at national level, and we illustrate that ENI could be an effective tool to inform national food security strategies. Under different future socioeconomic development scenarios, almost all sub-Saharan African countries achieve an adequate per capita energy intake level but their nutritional status varies with many countries deviating from recommended levels because of the unbalanced development of macronutrient intake levels; more improvement exists in fat and energy intake levels and less agreement in fruit-vegetable and animal protein intake levels. Scenario application proves that the relationship between ENI and undernutrition could readily be applied in future scenarios generated by integrated assessment models to provide insights into the impacts of various climate change scenarios, socioeconomic development pathways and alternative global trade policies on global hunger and undernutrition status.

Under different future socioeconomic development scenarios, almost all sub-Saharan African countries achieve an adequate per capita energy intake level but their nutritional status varies with many countries deviating from recommended levels because of the unbalanced development of macronutrient intake levels; more improvement exists in fat and energy intake levels and less agreement in fruit-vegetable and animal protein intake levels. Scenario application proves that the relationship between ENI and undernutrition could readily be applied in future scenarios generated by integrated assessment models to provide insights into the impacts of various climate change scenarios, socioeconomic development pathways and alternative global trade policies on global hunger and undernutrition status.

The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.5 fb(-1). The forward-backward asymmetry A(FB) of the dimuon system and the contribution F-H from the pseudoscalar, scalar, and tensor amplitudes to the decay width are measured as a function of the dimuon mass squared. The measurements are consistent with the standard model expectations.","author":[{"family":"Sirunyan","given":"A.

The measurement is performed combining the final data sets of the BABAR and Belle experiments collected at the (sic)(4S) resonance at the asymmetric-energy B factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at KEK, respectively. The data samples contain (471 +/- 3) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the BABAR detector and (772 +/- 11) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the Belle detector. The results of the measurement are sin 2 beta = 0.80 +/- 0.14 (stat) +/- 0.06 (syst) +/- 0.03 (model) and cos 2 beta = 0.91 +/- 0.22(stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) +/- 0.07(model). The result for the direct measurement of the angle beta of the CKM Unitarity Triangle is beta = [22.5 +/- 4.4 (stat) +/- 1.2 (syst) +/- 0.6(model)]degrees. The measurement assumes no direct CP violation in B-0 -¿ D-(*) h(0) decays. The quoted model uncertainties are due to the composition of the D-0 -¿ K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-) decay amplitude model, which is newly established by performing a Dalitz plot amplitude analysis using a high-statistics e(+)e(-) -¿ c (c) over bar data sample. CP violation is observed in B-0 -¿ D-(*) h(0) decays at the level of 5.1 standard deviations. The significance for cos 2 beta ¿ 0 is 3.7 standard deviations. The trigonometric multifold solution pi/2 - beta = (68.1 +/- 0.7)degrees is excluded at the level of 7.3 standard deviations. The measurement resolves an ambiguity in the determination of the apex of the CKM Unitarity Triangle.","author":[{"family":"Adachi","given":"I."},{"family":"Adye","given":"T."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"H."},{"family":"Ahn","given":"J.

The measurement is performed combining the final data sets of the BABAR and Belle experiments collected at the (sic)(4S) resonance at the asymmetric-energy B factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at KEK, respectively. The data samples contain (471 +/- 3) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the BABAR detector and (772 +/- 11) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the Belle detector. The results of the measurement are sin 2 beta = 0.80 +/- 0.14 (stat) +/- 0.06 (syst) +/- 0.03 (model) and cos 2 beta = 0.91 +/- 0.22(stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) +/- 0.07(model). The result for the direct measurement of the angle beta of the CKM Unitarity Triangle is beta = [22.5 +/- 4.4 (stat) +/- 1.2 (syst) +/- 0.6(model)]degrees. The measurement assumes no direct CP violation in B-0 -¿ D-(*) h(0) decays. The quoted model uncertainties are due to the composition of the D-0 -¿ K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-) decay amplitude model, which is newly established by performing a Dalitz plot amplitude analysis using a high-statistics e(+)e(-) -¿ c (c) over bar data sample. CP violation is observed in B-0 -¿ D-(*) h(0) decays at the level of 5.1 standard deviations. The significance for cos 2 beta ¿ 0 is 3.7 standard deviations. The trigonometric multifold solution pi/2 - beta = (68.1 +/- 0.7)degrees is excluded at the level of 7.3 standard deviations.

We also demonstrate that the same strategy can be used to produce orthorhombic SnSe nanostructures and nanomaterials. NPLs are grown through a screw dislocation-driven mechanism. This mechanism typically results in pyramidal structures, but we demonstrate here that the growth from multiple dislocations results in flower-like structures.

We also demonstrate that the same strategy can be used to produce orthorhombic SnSe nanostructures and nanomaterials. NPLs are grown through a screw dislocation-driven mechanism. This mechanism typically results in pyramidal structures, but we demonstrate here that the growth from multiple dislocations results in flower-like structures.

The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1), from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The mass spectra are analyzed for the presence of new resonances, and are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the framework of R-parity-violating supersymmetry assuming the pair production of scalar top quarks decaying via the hadronic coupling lambda `'(312) or lambda `'(323) and upper limits on the cross section as a function of the top squark mass are set. These results probe a wider range of masses than previously explored at the LHC, and extend the top squark mass limits in the (t) over tilde -¿ qq' scenario.","author":[{"family":"Sirunyan","given":"A.

The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1), from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The mass spectra are analyzed for the presence of new resonances, and are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the framework of R-parity-violating supersymmetry assuming the pair production of scalar top quarks decaying via the hadronic coupling lambda `'(312) or lambda `'(323) and upper limits on the cross section as a function of the top squark mass are set. These results probe a wider range of masses than previously explored at the LHC, and extend the top squark mass limits in the (t) over tilde -¿ qq' scenario.","author":[{"family":"Sirunyan","given":"A.

The absolute majority of wounded Maidan protesters, nearly 100 prosecution and defense witnesses, synchronized videos, and medical and ballistic examinations by government experts pointed unequivocally to the fact that the Maidan protesters were massacred by snipers located in Maidan-controlled buildings.

Moving beyond the analysis of AI as a general-purpose technology or its particular areas of application, we draw on the evolutionary analysis of sectoral systems and ask, “Who does what?” in AI. We provide a granular view of the complex interdependency patterns that connect developers, manufacturers, and users of AI. We distinguish between AI enablement, AI production, and AI consumption and analyze the emerging patterns of cospecialization between firms and communities. We find that AI provision is characterized by the dominance of a small number of Big Tech firms, whose downstream use of AI (e.g., search, payments, social media) has underpinned much of the recent progress in AI and who also provide the necessary upstream computing power provision (Cloud and Edge). These firms dominate top academic institutions in AI research, further strengthening their position. We find that AI is adopted by and benefits the small percentage of firms that can both digitize and access high-quality data. We consider how the AI sector has evolved differently in the three key geographies—China, the United States, and the European Union—and note that a handful of firms are building global AI ecosystems. Our contribution is to showcase the evolution of evolutionary thinking with AI as a case study: we show the shift from national/sectoral systems to triple-helix/innovation ecosystems and digital platforms. We conclude with the implications of such a broad evolutionary account for theory and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacobides","given":"Michael G."},{"family":"Brusoni","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Candelon","given":"Francois"}],"citation-key":"jacobides2021","container-title":"Strategy Science","container-title-short":"Strategy Science","DOI":"10.1287/stsc.2021.0148","ISSN":"2333-2050, 2333-2077","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"412-435","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Evolutionary Dynamics of the Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/stsc.2021.0148","volume":"6"},{"id":"Janeba2016","abstract":"Legal conflicts between multinational firms and host governments are often decided by international arbitration panels - as opposed to courts in the host country - due to provisions in international investment agreements known as Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS). Critics fear that ISDS panels favor multinational firms, and thus make governments reluctant to adopt appropriate policies (regulatory chill). In this paper I develop an economic model to define regulatory chill and to analyze the effects of ISDS. Regulatory chill occurs when losses from regulatory mismatch are intermediate rather than very high. Moreover, if national courts are more likely to decide in favor of the host government than an international court, a unilateral shift to ISDS by one country is welfare worsening for the country. The net welfare change is more favorable, and sometimes - but not always - positive, when i) (symmetric) countries switch together to an ISDS based system, and when ii) foreign investment responds elastically to profit conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Janeba","given":"Eckhard"}],"citation-key":"Janeba2016","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,23]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2887952","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Regulatory Chill and the Effect of Investor State Dispute Settlements","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2887952"},{"id":"janssen2016","author":[{"family":"Janssen","given":"Marijn"},{"family":"Kuk","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"janssen2016","ISSN":"0740-624X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"The challenges and limits of big data algorithms in technocratic governance","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"jasanoff2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jasanoff","given":"Sheila"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sang-Hyun"}],"citation-key":"jasanoff2015","DOI":"10.7208/chicago/9780226276663.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-226-27652-6 978-0-226-27649-6 978-0-226-27666-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dreamscapes of Modernity: Sociotechnical Imaginaries and the Fabrication of Power","title-short":"Dreamscapes of Modernity","type":"book","URL":"https://www.bibliovault.org/BV.landing.epl?ISBN=9780226276663"},{"id":"jaylampert2023","abstract":"It is time to update Deleuze and Guattari's contrast between Chess and Go in the ‘Nomadology’ Plateau with a discussion of AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence that revolutionised Go in 2016.

This article delves into the different realities of platform workers by juxtaposing two cases: location-based Amazon warehouse workers and web-based Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers. Informed by a historical materialist approach that accounts both for the contextual conditions and the agency of workers, this article asks: how does the organisation of workers (location-based vs. web-based) relate differently to their labour organisation and mobilisation in light of the COVID-19 pandemic? By investigating agency through analysing the structural power of workers (that is, marketplace and workplace), this article argues that both Amazon warehouse workers and MTurk workers experienced a further dwindling of their already weak marketplace power as a result of larger co-evolving political-economic conditions. The former workforce did experience, however, an increase in their workplace power given the growth of Amazon during the pandemic. The fact that they are location-based plays a crucial role in framing their struggle vis-à-vis the direct health risks and their ability to mobilise to disrupt the circulation line. MTurk workers, on the other hand, experienced a further weakening of their workplace power. Given the challenges in disrupting web-based gig labour, workers continue to express their agency through more alternative forms by instrumentalising digital spaces to foster solidarity and support each other for better working conditions. These contrasting case studies shed light therefore on the wider repercussions of the nature of the platform and its relation to the political-economic conditions for labour’s agency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kassem","given":"Sarrah"}],"citation-key":"kassem2022","container-title":"Global Political Economy","DOI":"10.1332/UVGT2823","ISSN":"2635-2257","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"page":"59-79","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Labour realities at Amazon and COVID-19: obstacles and collective possibilities for its warehouse workers and MTurk workers","title-short":"Labour realities at Amazon and COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/1/1/article-p59.xml","volume":"1"},{"id":"katz1995","abstract":"Many recent discussions of the decline of party are predicated on the assumption that the Duverger/socialist mass-party model is the only model for parties. We contend that this assumption is misconceived, that the mass-party model is only one, temporally limited and contingent model, and that it is necessary to differentiate notions of adaptation and change from notions of decline or failure. Following an analysis of how various models of party can be located in terms of the relationship between civil society and the state, we contend that the recent period has witnessed the emergence of a new model of party, the cartel party, in which colluding parties become agents of the state and employ the resources of the state (the party state) to ensure their own collective survival. Finally, we suggest that the recent challenge to party is in fact a challenge to the cartel that the established parties have created for themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Katz","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Mair","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"katz1995","container-title":"Party Politics","container-title-short":"Party Politics","DOI":"10.1177/1354068895001001001","ISSN":"1354-0688, 1460-3683","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",1]]},"language":"en","page":"5-28","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy: The Emergence of the Cartel Party","title-short":"Changing Models of Party Organization and Party Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354068895001001001","volume":"1"},{"id":"katz2006","call-number":"JF2051 .H336 2006","citation-key":"katz2006","editor":[{"family":"Katz","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Crotty","given":"William J."}],"event-place":"London ; Thousand Oaks, Calif","ISBN":"978-0-7619-4314-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocm63392155","number-of-pages":"550","publisher":"SAGE","publisher-place":"London ; Thousand Oaks, Calif","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Handbook of party politics","type":"book"},{"id":"katz2009","abstract":"We restate and clarify the idea of the “cartel party,” a concept that has found considerable traction in studies of parties throughout the democratic world, including those far from the original research site and data on which the cartel model was based. The cartel party thesis holds that political parties increasingly function like cartels, employing the resources of the state to limit political competition and ensure their own electoral success. The thesis has been subject to varied empirical testing and to substantial theoretical evaluation and criticism. Against this background, we look again at the cartel party thesis in order to clarify ambiguities in and misinterpretations of the original argument. We also suggest further refinements, specifications and extensions of the argument. Following a background review of the original thesis, we break it down into its core components, and then clarify the terms in which it makes sense to speak of cartelization and collusion. We then go on to explore some of the implications of the thesis for our understanding of contemporary democracies and patterns of party organization and party competition and we identify a possible agenda for future research in party scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Katz","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Mair","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"katz2009","container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","container-title-short":"Persp on Pol","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592709991782","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"753-766","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Cartel Party Thesis: A Restatement","title-short":"The Cartel Party Thesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1537592709991782/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},{"id":"Kelly2015","author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Mark GE"}],"citation-key":"Kelly2015","container-title":"New Formations","container-title-short":"New Formations","ISSN":"0950-2378","issue":"84-85","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"148-162","title":"Discipline is control: Foucault contra Deleuze","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},{"id":"kelsen2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelsen","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"kelsen2017","DOI":"10.4324/9780203790960","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Kelsen","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Treviño","given":"A.

King provides a provocative and engaging account of why globalisation is being rejected, what a world ruled by rival states with conflicting aims might look like, and how the pursuit of nationalist agendas could result in a race to the bottom. King argues that a rejection of globalisation and a return to \"autarky\" will risk economic and political conflict, and he uses lessons from history to gauge how best to avoid the worst possible outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Stephen D"}],"citation-key":"King2017","ISBN":"978-0-300-22630-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 984692648","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Grave new world: the end of globalization, the return of history","title-short":"Grave new world","type":"book","URL":"http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=4849019"},{"id":"kira2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kira","given":"Naoshi"}],"citation-key":"kira2019","container-title":"Educational Studies in Japan","container-title-short":"ESJ","DOI":"10.7571/esjkyoiku.13.55","ISSN":"1881-4832, 2187-5286","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"55-66","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dewey's Democratic Conception in Education and Democratic Schooling: Lessons from the United States for Japan in a Time of Democracy in Crisis","title-short":"Dewey's Democratic Conception in Education and Democratic Schooling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/esjkyoiku/13/0/13_55/_article","volume":"13"},{"id":"Kirkpatrick2006","author":[{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Parker","given":"David"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Y-F"}],"citation-key":"Kirkpatrick2006","container-title":"Transnational Corporations","container-title-short":"Transnational Corporations","ISSN":"1014-9562","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"143","title":"Foreign direct investment in infrastructure in developing countries: does regulation make a difference?","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},{"id":"Kitchin2017","author":[{"family":"Kitchin","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"Kitchin2017","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","container-title-short":"Information, Communication & Society","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"14-29","title":"Thinking critically about and researching algorithms","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},{"id":"kjosen2019","author":[{"family":"Kjøsen","given":"Atle Mikkola"},{"family":"Steinhoff","given":"James"}],"call-number":"303.483 3","citation-key":"kjosen2019","collection-title":"Digital barricades: interventions in digital culture and politics","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78680-395-5 978-1-78680-396-2 978-0-7453-3860-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Pluto Press","publisher-place":"London","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Inhuman power: artificial intelligence and the future of capitalism","title-short":"Inhuman power","type":"book"},{"id":"kleinIntroductionSocialInnovation2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Klein","given":"Juan-Luis"}],"citation-key":"kleinIntroductionSocialInnovation2013","container-author":[{"family":"Moulaert","given":"Frank"},{"family":"MacCallum","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Mehmood","given":"Abid"},{"family":"Hamdouch","given":"Abdelillah"}],"container-title":"The International Handbook on Social Innovation","DOI":"10.4337/9781849809993.00010","ISBN":"978-1-84980-999-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"9-12","publisher":"Edward Elgar Publishing","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Introduction: social innovation at the crossroads between science, economy and society","title-short":"Introduction","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781849809986.00010.xml"},{"id":"kli2018a","author":[{"family":"Kli","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"kli2018a","container-title":"Cosmos and History","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"125-146","title":"Auto-Poiesis: The Self and the Principle of Creativity in the Philosophical Anthropology and Psychoanalysis of Cornelius Castoriadis","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},{"id":"kluver2011","abstract":"Why are some interest groups able to lobby political decisions successfully whereas others are not?

The application of a term derived from the level of the party system (`cartel') to individual parties does not seem to be a happy choice, while the reality of western party systems does not show an effective cartel of parties.

We conduct a field experiment in which we send both handwritten and machine-generated letters (a total of 32,398 emails) to 7132 state legislators. We compare legislative response rates for the human versus machine-generated constituency letters to gauge whether language models can approximate inauthentic constituency voices at scale. Legislators were only slightly less likely to respond to artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content than to human-written emails; the 2% difference in response rate was statistically significant but substantively small. Qualitative evidence sheds light on the potential perils that this technology presents for democratic representation, but also suggests potential techniques that legislators might employ to guard against misuses of language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreps","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kriner","given":"Douglas L."}],"citation-key":"kreps2023","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/14614448231160526","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"language":"en","page":"146144482311605","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The potential impact of emerging technologies on democratic representation: Evidence from a field experiment","title-short":"The potential impact of emerging technologies on democratic representation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448231160526"},{"id":"Kriesky2004","author":[{"family":"Kreisky","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"Kriesky2004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"publisher":"na","title":"Geschlecht als politische und politikwissenschaftliche Kategorie","type":"book"},{"id":"kucukRojavaExperiencePossibilities2016","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Küçük","given":"Bülent"},{"family":"Özselçuk","given":"Ceren"}],"citation-key":"kucukRojavaExperiencePossibilities2016","container-title":"South Atlantic Quarterly","container-title-short":"South Atlantic Quarterly","DOI":"10.1215/00382876-3425013","ISSN":"0038-2876, 1527-8026","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"en","page":"184-196","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Rojava Experience: Possibilities and Challenges of Building a Democratic Life","title-short":"The Rojava Experience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/south-atlantic-quarterly/article/115/1/184-196/3804","volume":"115"},{"id":"kuyper2016","abstract":"This article explores the relationship between non-electoral representatives and democratic legitimacy by combining the recent constructivist turn in political representation with systemic work in deliberative theory.

Second, deliberative democracy offers a productive toolkit by which to evaluate these agents. I develop a framework of systemic representation which depicts the elemental parts of a democratic system and assigns normative standards according to the space occupied. The framework gives priority of democratic analysis to the systemic level. This helps mitigate a central concern in the constructivist turn which suggests that representatives mobilize constituencies in ways that are susceptible to framing and manipulation.

We will then retrace the influence of the cybernetic paradigm on structuralism. Starting with the historic meeting between Roman Jakobson and Claude Lévi-Strauss, we will illustrate that structural phonology is directly inspired by discoveries stemming from the informational model. In the same perspective, the conceptual borrowings of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan from cybernetics will be identified and analyzed. Then, we will address the matter of the relationship between postmodern theories and the cybernetic paradigm. The philosophical movement towards deconstruction, as well as Deleuze and Guattari?s philosophy, will be analyzed based on how they relate to this paradigm.

Reviewing the IR literature on cyberspace and internet governance, this paper demonstrates that these debates rest on very traditional understandings of territory and the state, focusing on ways that hard-shelled “power containers” are recreated in cyberspace. Using a practice-oriented conceptual framework drawing on insights from critical geography, the paper highlights how state, corporate, and private actors deterritorialize and reterritorialize cyberspace. Results indicate that there are multiple ways to territorialize cyberspace beyond the reconstruction of the “national territory” and that a multitude of actors engage in territorializing practices.

To the Icelandic Vikings in Northern Europe a few centuries later, it meant gathering every summer in a large field, a place where they held their own annual \"parliament,\" and similarly talking things through until they got to relatively consensual decisions about the common's fate. Our contemporary representative democracies are very different. Modern Parliaments are intimidating buildings that are much harder to access for ordinary citizens-quite literally. They are typically gated and guarded, and it often feels as if only certain types of people-people with the right suit, accent, bank account, connections, even last names-are welcome to enter them. In Open Democracy, Landemore revitalizes the model of success from ancient open democracies alongside the problems of the present-day representative democracies in order to get to the heart of the issues which contemporary democratic societies are dealing with today. Something has been lost between the two, Landemore argues: accessibility; openness to the ordinary man and woman. Landemore believes the move to \"representative\" democracy, a mediated form of democracy seen as unavoidable in mass, commercial societies, also became a move towards democratic closure, and exclusivity. Open Democracy asks how can we recover the openness of ancient democracies in today's world, and would it help the crisis of democracy? In diagnosing what is wrong with representative democracy, Landemore offers a normative alternative and strategy-one that is more true to the democratic ideal of \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" This alternative conception (open democracy) is one Landemore believes can be used to imagine and design more participatory, responsive, accountable, and smarter institutions, thereby strengthening our democracies along with on the whole, our societies\"--","author":[{"family":"Landemore","given":"Hélène"}],"call-number":"JC423","citation-key":"landemore2020","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-20872-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Open democracy: reinventing popular rule for the twenty-first century","title-short":"Open democracy","type":"book"},{"id":"Lash2007","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The treatment in what follows of the politics of hegemony is not per se one of Gramsci, or Laclau or of Stuart Hall's earlier work.

Algorithms on and beyond the Internet are increasingly influencing, aiding, or replacing human decision-making in many life domains. Their far-reaching, multifaceted economic and social impact, which results from the governance\n              by\n              algorithms, is widely acknowledged. However, suitable policy reactions, that is, the governance\n              of\n              algorithms, are the subject of controversy in academia, politics, industry, and civil society. This governance by and of algorithms is to be understood in the wider context of current technical and societal change, and in connection with other emerging trends. In particular, expanding algorithmizing of life domains is closely interrelated with and dependent on growing datafication and big data on the one hand, and rising automation and artificial intelligence in modern, digitized societies on the other. Consequently, the assessments and debates of these central developmental trends in digitized societies overlap extensively.\n            \n            Research on the governance by and of algorithms is highly interdisciplinary. Communication studies contributes to the formation of so-called “critical algorithms studies” with its wide set of sub-fields and approaches and by applying qualitative and quantitative methods. Its contributions focus both on the impact of algorithmic systems on traditional media, journalism, and the public sphere, and also cover effect analyses and risk assessments of algorithmic-selection applications in many domains of everyday life. The latter includes the whole range of public and private governance options to counter or reduce these risks or to safeguard ethical standards and human rights, including communication rights in a digital age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Latzer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Just","given":"Natascha"}],"citation-key":"latzerGovernanceAlgorithmsInternet2020","container-author":[{"family":"Latzer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Just","given":"Natascha"}],"container-title":"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication","DOI":"10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.904","ISBN":"978-0-19-022861-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,28]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Governance by and of Algorithms on the Internet: Impact and Consequences","title-short":"Governance by and of Algorithms on the Internet","type":"chapter","URL":"https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-904"},{"id":"lawrencehamilton2023","author":[{"literal":"Lawrence Hamilton"},{"literal":"Monica Brito Vieira"},{"literal":"L.

Money, the stock market, price differentials, algorithms, and scientific equations and formulas constitute semiotic \"motors\" that make capitalism's social and technical machines run, bypassing representation and consciousness to produce social subjections and semiotic enslavements. Lazzarato contrasts Deleuze and Guattari's complex semiotics with the political theories of Jacques Rancière, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, Paolo Virno, and Judith Butler, for whom language and the public space it opens still play a fundamental role. Lazzarato asks: What are the conditions necessary for political and existential rupture at a time when the production of subjectivity represents the primary and perhaps most important work of capitalism? What are the specific tools required to undo the industrial mass production of subjectivity undertaken by business and the state? What types of organization must we construct for a process of subjectivation that would allow us to escape the hold of social subjection and machinic enslavement?

In DOSNs, users can set up their own server, or instance, while they can actually interact with users of other instances. Moreover, by adopting the same communication protocol, DOSNs become part of a massive social network, namely the Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the Fediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted attention from the research community. Existing studies are however limited to an analysis of a relatively outdated sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level, while several open questions have not been answered yet, especially at the instance level. In this work, we aim at pushing forward our understanding of the Fediverse by leveraging the primary role of Mastodon therein. Our first contribution is the building of an up-to-date and highly representative dataset of Mastodon. Upon this new data, we have defined a network model over Mastodon instances and exploited it to investigate three major aspects: the structural features of the Mastodon network of instances from a macroscopic as well as a mesoscopic perspective, to unveil the distinguishing traits of the underlying federative mechanism; the backbone of the network, to discover the essential interrelations between the instances; and the growth of Mastodon, to understand how the shape of the instance network has evolved during the last few years, also when broading the scope to account for instances belonging to other platforms. Our extensive analysis of the above aspects has provided a number of findings that reveal distinguishing features of Mastodon and that can be used as a starting point for the discovery of all the DOSN Fediverse.","author":[{"literal":"Lucio La Cava"},{"family":"La Cava","given":"Lucio"},{"literal":"Sergio Greco"},{"family":"Greco","given":"Sergio"},{"literal":"Andrea Tagarelli"},{"family":"Tagarelli","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"luciolacava2021","container-title":"arXiv: Social and Information Networks","DOI":"10.1007/s41109-021-00392-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,29]]},"note":"ARXIV_ID: 2106.15473\nMAG ID: 3177149577\nS2ID: 9c6f94145ac1c449053b4c412a8702924dcc4170","title":"Understanding the growth of the Fediverse through the lens of Mastodon","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"Ludwig2012","author":[{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Gundula"}],"citation-key":"Ludwig2012","container-title":"Haberler, Helga/Hajek, Katharina/Ludwig, Gundula/Paloni, Sara (Hg.): Que [e] r zum Staat.

Drawing on the tradition of the social construction of technology (SCOT) and 17 qualitative expert interviews it discusses how search engines and their revenue models are negotiated and stabilized in a network of actors and interests, website providers and users first and foremost. It further shows how corporate search engines and their capitalist ideology are solidified in a socio-political context characterized by a techno-euphoric climate of innovation and a politics of privatization. This analysis provides a valuable contribution to contemporary search engine critique mainly focusing on search engines' business models and societal implications. It shows that a shift of perspective is needed from impacts search engines have on society towards social practices and power relations involved in the construction of search engines to renegotiate search engines and their algorithmic ideology in the future.","author":[{"family":"Mager","given":"Astrid"}],"citation-key":"Mager2014","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"Vol.15(5)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"page":"769-787","title":"ALGORITHMIC IDEOLOGY: How capitalist society shapes search engines","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"mager2014a","author":[{"family":"Mager","given":"Astrid"}],"citation-key":"mager2014a","container-title":"tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

Professor Manin challenges the conventional view that representative democracy is no more than an indirect form of government by the people, in which citizens elect representatives only because they cannot assemble and govern in person. The argument is developed by examining the historical moments when the present institutional arrangements were chosen from among the then available alternatives. Professor Manin reminds us that while today representative institutions and democracy appear as virtually indistinguishable, when representative government was first established in Europe and America, it was designed in opposition to democracy proper. Drawing on the procedures used in earlier republican systems, from classical Athens to Renaissance Florence, in order to highlight the alternatives that were forsaken, Manin brings to the fore the generally overlooked results of representative mechanisms. These include the elitist aspect of elections and the non-binding character of campaign promises.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Manin","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"manin1997a","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511659935","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-521-45891-7 978-0-521-45258-8 978-0-511-65993-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",2,28]]},"license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Principles of Representative Government","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511659935/type/book"},{"id":"Mansbridge1987","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mansbridge","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Barber","given":"Benjamin R."}],"citation-key":"Mansbridge1987","container-title":"The American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.2307/1962594","ISSN":"00030554","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987",12]]},"page":"1341","source":"CrossRef","title":"Strong Democracy: Participatory Politics for a New Age","title-short":"Strong Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1962594?origin=crossref","volume":"81"},{"id":"mansbridge1999","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mansbridge","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"mansbridge1999","container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.2307/2647821","ISSN":"0022-3816, 1468-2508","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",8]]},"language":"en","page":"628-657","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Should Blacks Represent Blacks and Women Represent Women?

These regimes promise access to resources and entitlements, while also facilitating people’s visibility to states and therefore their governability. For many, proving one’s identity presents no challenge; however, it is estimated that a billion people have no oﬃcial proof of identity. Meanwhile, the humanitarian sector is undergoing a transformation in which digital identity, mobile connectivity and digital ﬁnance are central features. Through a data justice lens, this paper explores customer identiﬁcation regimes in two country contexts in which large displaced populations are present: Uganda and Bangladesh. The two cases reveal divergent approaches to regulating refugee identiﬁcation: while Uganda’s policy environment has recently become more inclusive, Bangladesh’s proves to be particularly restrictive. We reﬂect on what these cases mean for the future development of digital identity systems by the humanitarian sector and the implications for data justice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Linnet"}],"citation-key":"martin2021","container-title":"Information Technology for Development","container-title-short":"Information Technology for Development","DOI":"10.1080/02681102.2020.1811943","ISSN":"0268-1102, 1554-0170","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"50-66","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exclusion and inclusion in identification: regulation, displacement and data justice","title-short":"Exclusion and inclusion in identification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02681102.2020.1811943","volume":"27"},{"id":"marx1962","author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"marx1962","container-title":"KARL MARX","issued":{"date-parts":[["1962"]]},"language":"de","source":"Zotero","title":"INSTITUT FÜR M A R X I S M U S - L E N I N I S M U S BEIM ZK DER SED","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"marx1978","author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Nicolaus","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"marx1978","collection-title":"Penguin classics","edition":"23. print","ISBN":"978-0-14-044575-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 933133143","number-of-pages":"904","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Grundrisse: foundations of the critique of political economy (rough draft)","title-short":"Grundrisse","type":"book"},{"id":"Marx1999","author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"Marx1999","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-320-00217-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"German","note":"OCLC: 634615644","publisher":"Dietz","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"MEW 17","type":"book"},{"id":"marxMarxFerdinandDomela1992","author":[{"family":"Marx","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"marxMarxFerdinandDomela1992","container-title":"Karl Marx, Frederick Engels: Collected works","container-title-short":"Karl Marx, Frederick Engels: Collected works","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"page":"1880-1883","title":"Marx to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},{"id":"Math131091216","abstract":"Recall the complex numbers: the plane with addition and multiplication.

On the one hand, Deleuze shares with his post-structuralist contemporaries the commitment to Nietzsche’s project of overturning Platonism and the critique of representation. On the other hand, while post-structuralism for the most part unfolded under the aegis of Heidegger’s pronouncements on the end of philosophy and the overcoming of metaphysics, for Deleuze the critique of representation constitutes the necessary condition for the reaffirmation of philosophy’s rights to metaphysical speculation. In this respect, Deleuze can be regarded as an important predecessor to the speculative/ontological turn. Therefore an engagement with Deleuze’s thought presents an opportunity to better understand the current conjuncture in the humanities. This paper presents an account of Deleuze’s critique of representation by tracing his argument against representation and in favour of intuitive knowledge and speculative metaphysics through a close reading of a few select and particularly revealing places in Deleuze’s early writings. The conclusion then places this discussion of Deleuze’s thought in the context of the recent turn in the humanities and continental philosophy away from post-structuralism and towards speculative realism.","author":[{"literal":"Matija Jelača"},{"family":"Jelača","given":"Matija"},{"literal":"Matija Jelača"},{"literal":"Matija Jelača"}],"citation-key":"matijajelaca2018","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2907686079\nS2ID: 9ea8b60d7b2911bb2981c3a81c9925f0d10ff20c","page":"35-57","title":"Deleuze's Critique of Representation Between Post-Structuralism and Speculative Realism","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},{"id":"mayer","author":[{"family":"Mayer","given":"Dr Katja"}],"citation-key":"mayer","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Open for Whom?

I also argue that the apparatus that performs this change owes as much to everyday business models as it does to mass surveillance. I look at technical changes at the level of data structures, such as the move to NoSQL databases, and how this combines with data-mining and machine learning to accelerate the use of prediction as a form of governance. The consequent confusion between correlation and causation leads, I assert, to the creation of states of exception. I set out what I mean by states of exception using the ideas of Giorgio Agamben, focusing on the aspects most relevant to algorithmic regulation: force-of and topology. I argue that the effects of these states of exception escape legal constraints such as concepts of privacy. Having characterised this as a potentially totalising change and an erosion of civil liberties, I ask in what ways the states of exception might be opposed. I follow Agamben by drawing on Walter Benjamin?s concept of pure means as a tactic that is itself outside the frame of law-producing or law-preserving activity. However, the urgent need to respond requires more than a philosophical stance, and I examine two examples of historical resistance that satisfy Benjamin?s criteria. For each, in turn, I draw connections to contemporary cases of digital dissent that exhibit some of the same characteristics. I conclude that it is possible both theoretically and practically to resist the coming states of exception, and I end by warning what is at stake if we do not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"McQuillan","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"McQuillan2015","container-title":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367549415577389","ISSN":"1367-5494","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,16]]},"page":"564-576","title":"Algorithmic states of exception","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367549415577389","volume":"18"},{"id":"McQuillan2018","abstract":"The nature of machine learning\noperations mean they will actually deepen some humanitarian problematics and introduce new ones of their\nown.

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mikolov","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"mikolov2013","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.1310.4546","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546","version":"1"},{"id":"mill2023","citation-key":"mill2023","contributor":[{"family":"Mill","given":"John Stuart"},{"family":"Gröls-Verlag","given":"Redaktion"}],"edition":"1.

Interviews with British social anthropologists working in, and outside, academia provide insights into how the practices and meanings of ethnography are being reworked. UK policy expectations that research (and its impact) can be measured, monitored and accounted for in monetary terms place particular demands on qualitative social research. To make our case, we focus on the prominence of the business metaphor of the ?value chain? in contemporary accounting practice and its use in the quantitative measurement of social research. Within social anthropology this new economy of measurement can be seen in debates over fieldwork practice. We show that as anthropology departments harden their methodological allegiances to fieldwork, very different understandings of ethnography are being developed beyond the academy. We conclude that methods, and debates over methods, are prisms through which to understand the changing social and economic expectations placed upon qualitative research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mills","given":"David"},{"family":"Ratcliffe","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Mills2012","container-title":"Qualitative Research","container-title-short":"Qualitative Research","DOI":"10.1177/1468794111420902","ISSN":"1468-7941","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,1]]},"page":"147-164","title":"After method?

Spivak`s essay hones in on the historical and ideological factors that obstruct the possibility of being heard for those who inhabit the periphery. It is a probing interrogation of what it means to have political subjectivity, to be able to access the state, and to suffer the burden of difference in a capitalist system that promises equality yet withholds it at every turn. Since its publication, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" has been cited, invoked, imitated, and critiqued. In these phenomenal essays, eight scholars take stock of the effects and response to Spivak`s work. They begin by contextualizing the piece within the development of subaltern and postcolonial studies and the quest for human rights. Then, through the lens of Spivak`s essay, they rethink historical problems of subalternity, voicing, and death. A final section situates \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" within contemporary issues, particularly new international divisions of labor and the politics of silence among indigenous women of Guatemala and Mexico. In an afterword, Spivak herself considers her essay`s past interpretations and future incarnations and the questions and histories that remain secreted in the original and revised versions of \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\"--both of which are reprinted in this book","citation-key":"morris2010","editor":[{"family":"Morris","given":"Rosalind C."}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-14384-4 978-0-231-14385-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"318","publisher":"Columbia Univ.

In our two case studies – Momentum’s relationship with the UK Labour Party and the Bernie Sanders-inspired ‘Our Revolution’ with the US Democratic Party – we highlight the conditions under which they emerge and their key characteristics. We analyse how party-driven movements express an ambivalence in terms of strategy (working inside and outside the party), political aims (aiming to transform the party and society) and organisation (in the desire to maintain autonomy while participating within party structures). Our analysis suggests that such party-driven movements provide a potential answer to political parties’ alienation from civil society and may thus be a more enduring feature of Anglo-American majoritarian party systems than the current literature suggests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Muldoon","given":"James"},{"family":"Rye","given":"Danny"}],"citation-key":"muldoon2020","container-title":"The British Journal of Politics and International Relations","container-title-short":"The British Journal of Politics and International Relations","DOI":"10.1177/1369148120919744","ISSN":"1369-1481, 1467-856X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8]]},"language":"en","page":"485-504","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conceptualising party-driven movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1369148120919744","volume":"22"},{"id":"muller-birn2013","author":[{"family":"Müller-Birn","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Dobusch","given":"Leonhard"},{"family":"Herbsleb","given":"James D"}],"citation-key":"muller-birn2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"title":"Work-to-Rule: The Emergence of Algorithmic Governance in Wikipedia","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"muller2000","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"Wolfgang C."}],"citation-key":"muller2000","container-title":"European Journal of Political Research","container-title-short":"Eur J Political Res","DOI":"10.1111/1475-6765.00515","ISSN":"0304-4130, 1475-6765","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",5]]},"language":"en","page":"309-333","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Political parties in parliamentary democracies: Making delegation and accountability work","title-short":"Political parties in parliamentary democracies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.00515","volume":"37"},{"id":"mullerIntroductionMachineLearning2016","abstract":"Machine learning has become an integral part of many commercial applications and research projects, but this field is not exclusive to large companies with extensive research teams.

Four opposing ideologies about how data flows around the network have become prominent because they are (a) implemented by technical standards, and (b) backed by influential geopolitical entities. Each of these specifies an ‘Internet’, described in relation to its implementation by a specific geopolitical entity. The four Internets of the title are: the Silicon Valley Open Internet, developed by pioneers of the Internet in the 1960s, based on principles of openness and efficient dataflow; the Brussels Bourgeois Internet, exemplified by the European Union, with a focus on human rights and legal administration; the DC Commercial Internet, exemplified by the Washington establishment and its focus on property rights and market solutions; and the Beijing Paternal Internet, exemplified by the Chinese government’s control of Internet content. These Internets have to coexist if the Internet as a whole is to remain connected. The book also considers the weaponization of the hacking ethic as the Moscow Spoiler model, exemplified by Russia’s campaigns of misinformation at scale; this is not a vision of the Internet, but is parasitic on the others. Each of these ideologies is illustrated by a specific policy question. Potential future directions of Internet development are considered, including the policy directions that India might take, and the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart cities, the Internet of Things, and social machines. A conclusion speculates on potential future Internets that may emerge alongside those described.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Hara","given":"Kieron"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Cerf","given":"Vinton"}],"citation-key":"ohara2021","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780197523681.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-752368-1 978-0-19-752371-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,13]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Four Internets: Data, Geopolitics, and the Governance of Cyberspace","title-short":"Four Internets","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/40014"},{"id":"olgazelinska2021","abstract":"Social movements aim to change society, but whether they actually cause change is difficult for researchers to assess.

The promises of social data are many, including understanding “what the world thinks” about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naïve usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range.

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Long"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Diogo"},{"family":"Wainwright","given":"Carroll L."},{"family":"Mishkin","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chong"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sandhini"},{"family":"Slama","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Schulman","given":"John"},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Kelton","given":"Fraser"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Simens","given":"Maddie"},{"family":"Askell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Welinder","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Christiano","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Leike","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"ouyang2022","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2203.02155","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155","version":"1"},{"id":"owen2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"R."},{"family":"Macnaghten","given":"P."},{"family":"Stilgoe","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"owen2012","container-title":"Science and Public Policy","container-title-short":"Science and Public Policy","DOI":"10.1093/scipol/scs093","ISSN":"0302-3427, 1471-5430","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"751-760","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Responsible research and innovation: From science in society to science for society, with society","title-short":"Responsible research and innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/spp/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/scipol/scs093","volume":"39"},{"id":"ozen2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Özen","given":"Hayriye"}],"citation-key":"ozen2015","container-title":"South European Society and Politics","container-title-short":"South European Society and Politics","DOI":"10.1080/13608746.2015.1099258","ISSN":"1360-8746, 1743-9612","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,2]]},"language":"en","page":"533-552","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Unfinished Grassroots Populism: The Gezi Park Protests in Turkey and Their Aftermath","title-short":"An Unfinished Grassroots Populism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13608746.2015.1099258","volume":"20"},{"id":"Pabst2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Pabst","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"Pabst2018","container-title":"Telos","DOI":"10.3817/0618183169","ISSN":"0090-6514, 1940-459X, 0090-6514","issue":"183","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"169-201","source":"Crossref","title":"“War of Position”: Liberal Interregnum and the Emergent Ideologies","title-short":"“War of Position”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journal.telospress.com/lookup/doi/10.3817/0618183169","volume":"2018"},{"id":"panizza2005","abstract":"Populism raises awkward questions about modern forms of democracy.

At the centre of the controversy lies the mechanism of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows private firms legal recourse against governments, if government interference has degraded their investment. Using newly released data covering 696 investment disputes, I assess some of the central claims about ISDS. I argue that the regime has indeed undergone a major shift: a majority of claims deal not with direct takings by low rule of law countries, but with regulation in democratic states. The result of this shift towards indirect expropriation affects firms’ incentives: claimants may gain even when they lose a challenge, if litigation can deter governments’ regulatory ambitions. The result, as I show, is an increase in the number of cases, accompanied by a precipitous decrease in their legal merit. Investors bringing indirect expropriation claims also appear far less likely to settle, and more likely to publicize the dispute, consistently with theoretical expectations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Pelc","given":"Krzysztof"}],"citation-key":"Pelc2016","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,10]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2778056","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Does the International Investment Regime Induce Frivolous Litigation?","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2778056"},{"id":"perea-morenoRenewableEnergyUrban2018","author":[{"family":"Perea-Moreno","given":"Miguel-Ángel"},{"family":"Hernández- Escobedo","given":"Quetzalcoatl"},{"family":"Perea","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"perea-morenoRenewableEnergyUrban2018","container-title":"Energies","container-title-short":"Energies","DOI":"10.3390/en11030577","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,7]]},"page":"577","title":"Renewable Energy in Urban Areas: Worldwide Research Trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},{"id":"Perelman1978","author":[{"family":"Perelman","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Perelman1978","container-title":"Journal of Economic Issues, 1 December 1978, Vol.12(4), pp.859-870","ISSN":"00213624","title":"Karl Marx's Theory of Science","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"perkinsPythonTextProcessing2014","author":[{"family":"Perkins","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"perkinsPythonTextProcessing2014","collection-title":"Packt open source","edition":"2. ed","event-place":"Birmingham","ISBN":"978-1-78216-785-3 978-1-78216-786-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 931703974","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Packt Publ","publisher-place":"Birmingham","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Python 3 text processing with NLTK 3 cookbook: over 80 practical recipes on natural language processing techniques using Python's NLTK 3.0","title-short":"Python 3 text processing with NLTK 3 cookbook","type":"book"},{"id":"Pfeffer2018","abstract":"Social media data is widely analyzed in computational social science.

These data are supposedly random samples of all platform activity. However, we demonstrate that, due to the nature of Twitter’s sampling mechanism, it is possible to deliberately influence these samples, the extent and content of any topic, and consequently to manipulate the analyses of researchers, journalists, as well as market and political analysts trusting these data sources. Our analysis also reveals that technical artifacts can accidentally skew Twitter’s samples. Samples should therefore not be regarded as random.

Doch seit einigen Jahren gibt es Bemühungen autoritärer wie demokratischer Staaten, sowohl digitale Anwendungen als auch die physischen und technischen Infrastrukturen des Internets ihrem souveränen Zugriff zu unterwerfen. Und auch die „Big Tech“-Unternehmen versuchen zunehmend, „ihren“ digitalen Raum exklusiv zu kontrollieren. In der Folge mehren sich die Warnungen vor einer möglichen Fragmentierung des Internets. Um diese Warnungen einzuordnen, bedient sich der Beitrag der Netzwerktheorie und zeichnet die Konflikte und Entwicklungen nach, die das Internet seit den frühen Visionen der Internet-Exzeptionalisten in den 1990er-Jahren bis zu aktuellen Souveränitätsbestrebungen geprägt haben. Es wird sichtbar, dass sowohl Staaten als auch Unternehmen seit einiger Zeit eine fundamentale Rekonfiguration der globalen digitalen Ordnung herbeizuführen versuchen. Ihr Bemühen, die Macht über Teilnetze zu festigen, verändert dabei auch die Strukturen des globalen Netzes und geht mit einer Stärkung autoritärer Ordnungsvorstellungen einher. Vor der Kontrastfolie der kosmopolitisch-liberalen Vision eines global geeinten Netzes stellt sich dies zwar als Fragmentierung dar. Der netzwerktheoretische Zugriff macht jedoch deutlich, warum die Pluralisierung des Internets noch nicht mit dessen Fragmentierung gleichzusetzen ist.\n          , \n            Abstract\n            To this day, the Internet holds the promise of uniting all people in a global communication network. However, in recent years both authoritarian and democratic governments have been trying to subject the Internet—from the level of its physical and technical infrastructure to its application layer—to their sovereign claims. Furthermore, “Big Tech” also tries to exert exclusive control over “its” digital realm. As a result, observers have raised concerns about a potential fragmentation of the Internet. Drawing on network theory, this article retraces the conflicts and developments that have shaped the Internet, from the exceptionalists’ visions in the 1990s to recent pursuits of digital sovereignty. It shows that states and companies have been trying for some time to bring about a fundamental reconfiguration of the global digital order. Their efforts to consolidate power over subnetworks are changing the structures of the global network. This change is accompanied by a strengthening of authoritarian ideas of order. Against the contrasting backdrop of the cosmopolitan-liberal vision of a globally united network, this dynamic can easily be interpreted as a beginning fragmentation. However, the network-theoretical approach makes it clear why the pluralization of the Internet is not yet synonymous with its fragmentation.\n          , \n            Résumé\n            Aujourd’hui encore, l’Internet porte la promesse d’unir tous les hommes dans un réseau de communication mondial. Néanmoins depuis quelques années, des États tant autoritaires que démocratiques s’efforcent de soumettre l’Internet à leur pouvoir souveraine, de ses applications jusqu’au niveau de l’infrastructure physique et technique. En plus, des entreprises « Big Tech » tentent également d’exercer un contrôle toujours plus exclusif sur « leurs » domaines numériques. Par conséquent, les mises en garde contre une éventuelle fragmentation d’Internet se multiplient. Pour évaluer ces avertissements, nous nous servons de la théorie des réseaux pour retracer les conflits et les évolutions qui ont marqué l’Internet depuis les premières visions dans les années 1990 jusqu’aux aspirations actuelles à la souveraineté numérique. Il devient ainsi évident que les États et les entreprises tentent depuis un certain temps de reconfigurer fondamentalement l’ordre numérique mondial. Des efforts pour consolider leur pouvoir sur des sous-réseaux modifient également les structures du réseau mondial. Ce changement s’accompagne d’un renforcement des représentations autoritaires de l’ordre. Dans le contexte de la vision cosmopolite et libérale d’un réseau global unifié, cela se présente comme une fragmentation. L’approche théorique du réseau montre toutefois pourquoi la pluralisation de l’Internet n’est pas encore synonyme de sa fragmentation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pohle","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Voelsen","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"pohle2022","container-title":"Berliner Journal für Soziologie","container-title-short":"Berlin J Soziol","DOI":"10.1007/s11609-022-00478-6","ISSN":"0863-1808, 1862-2593","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"de","page":"455-487","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Das Netz und die Netze.

Based on an ethnographic study from a citizen service centre in a Danish municipality, our analysis shows how the sense of time and space in these encounters is radically changed, and how the relationship between private and public is reframed in this context. In contrast to the idea of digital technologies as a neutral upgrade of the state administration leading to more efficient welfare provision, the article highlights the unintended effects of digitalization, showing how the traditional ideal of bureaucracy reflected in Weber’s legal-rational model, which described bureaucracy as hierarchical, rule-enforcing and impersonal, is reversed. We argue that attention to how digitalization changes daily bureaucratic encounters and the relation between public authorities and citizens, is lacking, both in policy and in the literature on digitalization and e-government.","author":[{"family":"Pors","given":"Anja Svejgaard"},{"family":"Pallesen","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"pors","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The reorganization of the bureaucratic encounter in a digitized public administration","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"poster2010","type":"book","collection-title":"Deleuze connections","edition":"reprinted","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-0-7486-3336-4","language":"eng","number-of-pages":"275","publisher":"Edinburgh Univ.

The first was Chile's experiment with peaceful socialist change under Salvador Allende; the second was the simultaneous attempt to build a computer system that would manage Chile's economy. Neither vision was fully realized—Allende's government ended with a violent military coup; the system, known as Project Cybersyn, was never completely implemented—but they hold lessons for today about the relationship between technology and politics.Drawing on extensive archival material and interviews, Medina examines the cybernetic system envisioned by the Chilean government—which was to feature holistic system design, decentralized management, human-computer interaction, a national telex network, near real-time control of the growing industrial sector, and modeling the behavior of dynamic systems. She also describes, and documents with photographs, the network's Star Trek-like operations room, which featured swivel chairs with armrest control panels, a wall of screens displaying data, and flashing red lights to indicate economic emergencies.Studying project Cybersyn today helps us understand not only the technological ambitions of a government in the midst of political change but also the limitations of the Chilean revolution. This history further shows how human attempts to combine the political and the technological with the goal of creating a more just society can open new technological, intellectual, and political possibilities. Technologies, Medina writes, are historical texts; when we read them we are reading history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Press","given":"The MIT"}],"citation-key":"pressCyberneticRevolutionaries","container-title":"The MIT Press","language":"en","title":"Cybernetic Revolutionaries","type":"webpage","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cybernetic-revolutionaries"},{"id":"przeworski1999","abstract":"This book examines whether the mechanisms of accountability characteristic of democratic systems are sufficient to induce the representatives to act in the best interest of the represented.

We present arguments at a theoretical and meta-theoretical level, leaving empirical analysis to a future writing. We hold it impossible: to fully dissociate normative from the analytical in constructing scientific thought, thus showing the importance of the notion of a \"good society\" to guide varied intellectual explorations; to deny the political role of education; and to detach from historicity of thought and policy prescriptions emerging from such theorizing, as not all social constructions are equal in terms of logical configuration, methodological rigor, or solid empirical proof.

(an electoral system) and a deliberative system based on sortition (a lottocratic system). Both systems are analyzed in three dimensions. The epistemic dimension concerns the rational quality of the democratic process. The power dimension concerns the distribution of power and the extent to which citizens genuinely control all decisions. The motivational dimension, finally, concerns citizens’ identification with the decision-making process and their willingness to abide by its outcomes. We argue that an electoral system is, in all three dimensions, normatively superior to a sortition-based system. Most prominently, we claim that electoral mechanisms provide visibility to the decision-making process. This enables a form of interactive representation in which citizens and their representatives engage in a joint process of opinion and will formation. Sortition, in contrast, is characterized by a democratically much poorer form of descriptive representation. The selected citizens are a representative sample of the wider citizenry, but they deliberate in a forum that remains mostly disconnected from that wider citizenry and therefore cannot shoulder the process of collective self-government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Rummens","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Geenens","given":"Raf"}],"citation-key":"rummens2023","container-title":"Res Publica","container-title-short":"Res Publica","DOI":"10.1007/s11158-023-09648-6","ISSN":"1356-4765, 1572-8692","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lottocracy Versus Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11158-023-09648-6"},{"id":"runciman2010","abstract":"Draws from political science, history, political theory, economics, and anthropology to answer the most important questions about political representation","author":[{"family":"Runciman","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"runciman2010","event-place":"Cambridge, UK","ISBN":"978-0-511-76821-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 645097590","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Political representation","type":"book"},{"id":"rupnikDemocracyFatiguePopulist2007","author":[{"family":"Rupnik","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"rupnikDemocracyFatiguePopulist2007","container-title":"Journal of Democracy","container-title-short":"Journal of Democracy","DOI":"10.1353/jod.2007.0078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,1]]},"page":"17-25","title":"From Democracy Fatigue to Populist Backlash","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},{"id":"russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2016","author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Stuart J."},{"family":"Norvig","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Ernest"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Douglas"}],"citation-key":"russellArtificialIntelligenceModern2016","collection-title":"Prentice Hall series in artificial intelligence","edition":"Third edition, Global edition","event-place":"Boston Columbus Indianapolis New York San Francisco Upper Saddle River Amsterdam, Cape Town Dubai London Madrid Milan Munich Paris Montreal Toronto Delhi Mexico City Sao Paulo Sydney Hong Kong Seoul Singapore Taipei Tokyo","ISBN":"978-1-292-15396-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1132","publisher":"Pearson","publisher-place":"Boston Columbus Indianapolis New York San Francisco Upper Saddle River Amsterdam, Cape Town Dubai London Madrid Milan Munich Paris Montreal Toronto Delhi Mexico City Sao Paulo Sydney Hong Kong Seoul Singapore Taipei Tokyo","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Artificial intelligence: a modern approach","title-short":"Artificial intelligence","type":"book"},{"id":"russellEstimatingValueSimulation1991","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"K.

Intuitively, it sounds very appealing: placing human concerns at the centre of AI development and use. However, this paper will use insights from the works of Michel Foucault (mostly\n              The Order of Things\n              ) to argue that the HCAI approach is deeply problematic in its assumptions. In particular, this paper will criticise four main assumptions commonly found within HCAI: human–AI hybridisation is desirable and unproblematic; humans are not currently at the centre of the AI universe; we should use humans as a way to guide AI development; AI is the next step in a continuous path of human progress; and increasing human control over AI will reduce harmful bias. This paper will contribute to the field of philosophy of technology by using Foucault's analysis to examine assumptions found in HCAI [it provides a Foucauldian conceptual analysis of a current approach (human-centredness) that aims to influence the design and development of a transformative technology (AI)], it will contribute to AI ethics debates by offering a critique of human-centredness in AI (by choosing Foucault, it provides a bridge between older ideas with contemporary issues), and it will also contribute to Foucault studies (by using his work to engage in contemporary debates, such as AI).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryan","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"ryan2024","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","container-title-short":"AI & Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-024-01976-2","ISSN":"0951-5666, 1435-5655","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"We’re only human after all: a critique of human-centred AI","title-short":"We’re only human after all","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-024-01976-2"},{"id":"salkin2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Salkin","given":"Wendy"}],"citation-key":"salkin2021","container-title":"Journal of Political Philosophy","container-title-short":"J Political Philosophy","DOI":"10.1111/jopp.12246","ISSN":"0963-8016, 1467-9760","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"429-455","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Conscription of Informal Political Representatives*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopp.12246","volume":"29"},{"id":"sanchezOrganizingIndependenceArtists1997","author":[{"family":"Sánchez","given":"Gonzalo J."}],"call-number":"N6850 .S25 1997","citation-key":"sanchezOrganizingIndependenceArtists1997","event-place":"Lincoln","ISBN":"978-0-8032-4255-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"number-of-pages":"235","publisher":"University of Nebraska Press","publisher-place":"Lincoln","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Organizing independence: the artists federation of the Paris Commune and its legacy, 1871-1889","title-short":"Organizing independence","type":"book"},{"id":"saward2009","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Saward","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"saward2009","container-title":"Journal of Political Philosophy","container-title-short":"J Political Philosophy","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00309.x","ISSN":"0963-8016, 1467-9760","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"1-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Authorisation and Authenticity: Representation and the Unelected*","title-short":"Authorisation and Authenticity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00309.x","volume":"17"},{"id":"saward2010","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Saward","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"saward2010","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579389.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-19-957938-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,6]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Representative Claim","type":"book","URL":"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579389.001.0001/acprof-9780199579389"},{"id":"saward2024","type":"chapter","abstract":"Abstract\n            This chapter explores a new and distinctive site of representative politics and its performance: the Square. The Square is a device for thinking about power and politics when the represented and representatives are physically co-present, such as in a city square or council chambers. The chapter brings ideas of participation and representation together. It argues that Hanna Pitkin’s inclusion of literal absence in her widely accepted definition of representation is misleading. Physical co-presence, virtual or remote co-presence, or an absence of co-presence are not central to the very meaning of representation. Evoking a sense of presence (Pitkin’s ‘in some sense’) through performing representative claims can and will occur in all these contexts, including the face-to-face. The chapter examines key dimensions of power and disempowerment in the Square, and how physical co-presence highlights performance—positioning of self, others, and material objects in space, the privileging of voice and movement, and so on. The analysis throws into relief key issues of where and when claims to representation are, or can be, performed, and contributes to our efforts to understand how context matters greatly to the dynamics of political representation.","container-title":"Bodies, Spaces, Claims","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-893490-5","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.1093/oso/9780198934905.003.0004\n\nCitation Key: saward2024","page":"70-90","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Presence, Power, and Performing Political Representation; Or, What Happens in the Square","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/doi/10.1093/oso/9780198934905.003.0004","editor":[{"family":"Diehl","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Saward","given":"Michael"}],"author":[{"family":"Saward","given":"Michael"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"citation-key":"saward2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"saward2024"},{"id":"scarrow2006","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Scarrow","given":"Susan E."}],"citation-key":"scarrow2006","container-title":"West European Politics","container-title-short":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402380600842148","ISSN":"0140-2382, 1743-9655","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9]]},"language":"en","page":"619-639","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Party subsidies and the freezing of party competition: Do cartel mechanisms work?","title-short":"Party subsidies and the freezing of party competition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380600842148","volume":"29"},{"id":"scarrow2015","author":[{"family":"Scarrow","given":"Susan E."}],"call-number":"JF2051 .S272 2015","citation-key":"scarrow2015","collection-title":"Comparative politics","edition":"First edition","event-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","ISBN":"978-0-19-966186-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn894270692","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"Oxford University Press : ECPR","publisher-place":"Oxford, United Kingdom","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Beyond party members: changing approaches to partisan mobilization","title-short":"Beyond party members","type":"book"},{"id":"schachingerCompleteGuideGoogle2017","abstract":"What is Google RankBrain?

What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent abilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Rylan"},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Brando"},{"family":"Koyejo","given":"Sanmi"}],"citation-key":"schaeffer2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2304.15004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004","version":"2"},{"id":"schichlEinfuhrungMathematischeArbeiten2018","author":[{"family":"Schichl","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Steinbauer","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"schichlEinfuhrungMathematischeArbeiten2018","collection-title":"Lehrbuch","edition":"3., überarbeitete Auflage","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-662-56806-4 978-3-662-56805-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"ger","note":"OCLC: 1037897272","number-of-pages":"533","publisher":"Springer Spektrum","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Einführung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"book"},{"id":"schichlEinfuhrungMathematischeArbeiten2018a","author":[{"family":"Schichl","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Steinbauer","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"schichlEinfuhrungMathematischeArbeiten2018a","collection-title":"Lehrbuch","edition":"3., überarbeitete Auflage","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-662-56805-7 978-3-662-56806-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"ger","note":"OCLC: 1037897272","number-of-pages":"533","publisher":"Springer Spektrum","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Einführung in das mathematische Arbeiten","type":"book"},{"id":"schick2023","abstract":"Language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable abilities to solve new tasks from just a few examples or textual instructions, especially at scale.

We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q\\&A system, two different search engines, a translation system, and a calendar.

After the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the Syrian army withdrew from the region, enabling the Party of Democratic Union (PYD) to introduce a Kurdish self-administration and later to establish the Canton Afrin as one of the three parts of the heavily Kurdish Democratic Federation of North-Syria, or Rojava. This self-administration, which had seen multi-party elections in 2017, included autonomy for a number of ethnic and religious groups, and provided a safe haven for up to 300,000 Syrian refugees, is now at risk of being annihilated. In this volume, Schmidinger provides a comprehensive history of the region and gives inhabitants of a variety of ethnicities, religions, political orientations, and walks of life the opportunity to speak for themselves.

(1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain.

She exposes how democratic theory and politics have long blocked from political citizenship anyone whose cognitive capacity falls below a threshold level--marginalization with real-world repercussions on the implementation of disability rights today.Simplican's compelling ethnographic analysis of the self-advocacy movement describes the obstacles it faces. From the outside, the movement must confront stiff budget cuts and dwindling memberships; internally, self-advocates must find ways to demand political standing without reinforcing entrenched stigma against people with profound cognitive disabilities. And yet Simplican's investigation also offers democratic theorists and disability activists a more emancipatory vision of democracy as it relates to disability--one that focuses on enabling people to engage in public and spontaneous action to disrupt exclusion and stigma.

Februar 2022 löste weltweites Entsetzen aus und führte zu weitreichenden internationalen Sanktionsmaßnahmen gegenüber der Russischen Föderation. Neben zahlreichen wirtschaftlichen und politischen Sanktionen entzündete sich im Verlauf der darauffolgenden Monate eine Debatte darüber, ob und inwiefern Teile der Internetinfrastruktur Russlands sanktioniert werden könnten. Hierbei wurde erneut auch ausdrücklich die Frage nach einer territorialen Abgrenzung des Internets gestellt und diskutiert. Jenes Diskursereignis reiht sich dabei in die nun schon seit einigen Jahren andauernde Debatte um die Fragmentierung, Territorialisierung und Instrumentalisierung des Cyberspace ein. Sie zieht sich durch die kurze, aber wechselhafte Geschichte des Internets auf eine Weise, die für die Untersuchung der Refiguration von Räumen von besonderem Interesse ist. Nach einer kurzen Rekonstruktion der Situation zu Beginn des russischen Einfalls in die Ukraine werden wir zunächst die Diskussion um die Fragmentierung des Internets skizzieren. In diesem Zusammenhang werden wir auf die Grundzüge der Internetinfrastruktur und ihrer Organisation bzw. „Governance“ eingehen. Im empirischen Teil dieses Beitrags fokussieren wir uns auf den Diskurs innerhalb der für Russland, die Ukraine und den europäischen Raum für die Registrierung von IP-Adressbereichen zuständigen Organisation RIPE, der mit dem Beginn des Krieges einsetzte. In der Untersuchung rekonstruieren wir den Verlauf des Sanktionsdiskurses innerhalb von RIPE, der in der transnationalen Öffentlichkeit über historisch gewachsene, deliberative und digitale Kommunikationsformen geführt wurde. Als Folge dieses Diskurses wurde der Status quo des Internets als ein offenes Netzwerk deutlich hervorgehoben, während in anderen Bereichen die material-räumlichen, politischen und wirtschaftlichen Grenzen zum Territorium Russlands scharf gezogen wurden. Daran zeigt sich die Rolle der Raumfiguren des Territoriums und des Netzwerkes, deren Spannungsverhältnis sich über Diskurse und Diskursformen, Governance-Organisationen bis hin zur technologisch-materialen Infrastruktur erstreckt. Ihre oftmals gegenläufigen räumlichen Dynamiken führen weder zu einer Fragmentierung noch zu einer bloßen weaponization, sondern können in ihrer gleichzeitigen räumlichen Realisierung als Refiguration des Internets beschrieben werden.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sönmez","given":"Sezgin"},{"family":"Knoblauch","given":"Hubert"}],"citation-key":"soenmez2023","contributor":[{"literal":"Technische Universität Berlin"}],"DOI":"10.14279/DEPOSITONCE-19598","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"de","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","publisher":"Technische Universität Berlin","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Grenzen im Internet?

However, little is known about how citizens have interacted with local authorities in recent years. This article studies modes of interaction between citizens and public servants in the co-production of participatory budgeting projects in Dnipro, Kyiv, and Lviv. I adopt a relational approach to democracy, focusing on the participants’ assessments of their cooperation with municipal authorities. The article draws on 51 semi-structured interviews and is informed by a digital ethnography. The results reveal that the participants’ oversight is crucial because public servants regularly attempt to block those proposals which do not have precedents. The degree of the participants’ influence varied in the three cases, yet in each case the participants’ greater understanding of local self-governance processes was essential for facilitating adequate responses by local authorities. These findings not only result in a better understanding of the development of urban democracy in Ukraine prior to 2022, but also highlight the significant role participatory processes can play in the prospective democratic governance in Ukraine.","author":[{"literal":"Sophie Schmäing"}],"citation-key":"sophieschmaing2023","container-title":"European Societies: The Official Journal of the European Sociological Association","DOI":"10.1080/14616696.2023.2183972","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,5]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4323316061\nS2ID: e9f90e4a9f5ae4ed06355a3b5166cdbb26569cd3","page":"1-23","title":"Urban democracy in post-Maidan Ukraine: conflict and cooperation between citizens and local governments in participatory budgeting","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"souBreakthroughsASwedishBiotechnology2000","author":[{"literal":"SOU"}],"citation-key":"souBreakthroughsASwedishBiotechnology2000","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"title":"BreakthroughsA Swedish biotechnology policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.regeringen.se/49b720/contentassets/373e6b035fc34ee484ef20ebd8477a7d/engelsk-sammanfattning"},{"id":"sovacool2020","abstract":"Policy coordination is needed for global supply chains\n          , \n            \n              Climate change mitigation will create new natural resource and supply chain opportunities and dilemmas, because substantial amounts of raw materials will be required to build new low-carbon energy devices and infrastructure (\n              1\n              ).

These extractive and smelting industries have thus left a legacy in many parts of the world of environmental degradation, adverse impacts to public health, marginalized communities and workers, and biodiversity damage.

We then propose four holistic recommendations to make mining and metal processing more sustainable and just and to make the mining and extractive industries more efficient and resilient.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Sovacool","given":"Benjamin K."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Saleem H."},{"family":"Bazilian","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Radley","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Nemery","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Okatz","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Mulvaney","given":"Dustin"}],"citation-key":"sovacool2020","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaz6003","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6473","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuse","page":"30-33","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sustainable minerals and metals for a low-carbon future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz6003","volume":"367"},{"id":"spears1994","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article examines how interaction by means of computer-mediated communication (CMC) affects the operation of both status differentials and power relations.

Such a shift significantly alters how the category culture has long been practiced, experienced and understood, giving rise to what, following Alexander Galloway, I am calling ?algorithmic culture?. The purpose of this essay is to trace some of the conceptual conditions out of which algorithmic culture has emerged and, in doing so, to offer a preliminary treatment on what it is. In the vein of Raymond Williams? Keywords, I single out three terms whose bearing on the meaning of the word culture seems to have been unusually strong during the period in question: information, crowd and algorithm. My claim is that the offloading of cultural work onto computers, databases and other types of digital technologies has prompted a reshuffling of some of the words most closely associated with culture, giving rise to new senses of the term that may be experientially available but have yet to be well named, documented or recorded. This essay, though largely historical, concludes by connecting the dots critically to the present day. What is at stake in algorithmic culture is the gradual abandonment of culture?s publicness and the emergence of a strange new breed of elite culture purporting to be its opposite.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Striphas","given":"Ted"}],"citation-key":"striphas2015","container-title":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367549415577392","ISSN":"1367-5494","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,16]]},"page":"395-412","title":"Algorithmic culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367549415577392","volume":"18"},{"id":"strom1990","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Strom","given":"Kaare"}],"citation-key":"strom1990","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.2307/2111461","ISSN":"00925853","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",5]]},"page":"565","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Behavioral Theory of Competitive Political Parties","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111461?origin=crossref","volume":"34"},{"id":"Strom2007","author":[{"family":"Strøm","given":"Kaare W"},{"family":"Nyblade","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"Strom2007","container-title":"The Oxford handbook of comparative politics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"title":"Coalition theory and government formation","type":"chapter"},{"id":"suli2003","author":[{"family":"Süli","given":"Endre"},{"family":"Mayers","given":"David Francis"}],"call-number":"518","citation-key":"suli2003","event-place":"Cambridge New York","ISBN":"978-0-521-00794-8 978-0-521-81026-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge New York","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"An introduction to numerical analysis","type":"book"},{"id":"Sundström2013","author":[{"family":"Sundström","given":"Aksel"},{"family":"Stockemer","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"Sundström2013","container-title":"QoG Working Paper Series","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"6","title":"Quality of government affect voter turnout in the European regions","type":"article-journal","volume":"2013"},{"id":"suryanarayanan2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Suryanarayanan","given":"Sainath"},{"family":"Kleinman","given":"Daniel Lee"}],"citation-key":"suryanarayanan2019","DOI":"10.36019/9780813574615","ISBN":"978-0-8135-7461-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,31]]},"publisher":"Rutgers University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vanishing Bees: Science, Politics, and Honeybee Health","title-short":"Vanishing Bees","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.36019/9780813574615/html"},{"id":"susskind2022","author":[{"family":"Susskind","given":"Jamie"}],"citation-key":"susskind2022","ISBN":"1-5266-2530-X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Bloomsbury publishing","title":"The digital republic: on freedom and democracy in the 21st century","type":"book"},{"id":"susskind2022a","author":[{"family":"Susskind","given":"Jamie"}],"citation-key":"susskind2022a","edition":"First Pegasus Books cloth edition","event-place":"New York London","ISBN":"978-1-64313-901-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"442","publisher":"Pegasus Books","publisher-place":"New York London","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The digital republic: on freedom and democracy in the 21st century","title-short":"The digital republic","type":"book"},{"id":"svirsky2010","author":[{"family":"Svirsky","given":"Marcelo"}],"citation-key":"svirsky2010","ISBN":"978-0-7486-4052-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,1]]},"title":"Deleuze and Political Activism","type":"book"},{"id":"swedenbioNewSwedenBIOReport2020","abstract":"​The Swedish drug discovery and development pipeline is expanding and maturing, with more projects starting up and moving into later phases, while also...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"literal":"SwedenBIO"}],"citation-key":"swedenbioNewSwedenBIOReport2020","container-title":"Mynewsdesk","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"sv","title":"New SwedenBIO report shows major expansion and maturity in Sweden’s drug development pipeline","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/swedenbio/pressreleases/new-swedenbio-report-shows-major-expansion-and-maturity-in-swedens-drug-development-pipeline-3004114"},{"id":"swedenbioSwedishLifeScience","abstract":"SwedenBIO is the national non-profit association for the life science industry in Sweden, with almost 300 members.

The emphasis is on rigour and foundations of analysis. Beginning with the construction of the number systems and set theory, the book discusses the basics of analysis (limits, series, continuity, differentiation, Riemann integration), through to power series, several variable calculus and Fourier analysis, and then finally the Lebesgue integral. These are almost entirely set in the concrete setting of the real line and Euclidean spaces, although there is some material on abstract metric and topological spaces. The book also has appendices on mathematical logic and the decimal system. The entire text (omitting some less central topics) can be taught in two quarters of 25-30 lectures each. The course material is deeply intertwined with the exercises, as it is intended that the student actively learn the material (and practice thinking and writing rigorously) by proving several of the key results in the theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Terence"}],"citation-key":"tao2016","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-981-10-1803-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 960706942","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Analysis II: Third Edition.","title-short":"Analysis II","type":"book","URL":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-10-1803-9"},{"id":"taoAnalysis2016","author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Terence"}],"citation-key":"taoAnalysis2016","event-place":"Place of publication not identified","ISBN":"978-981-10-1788-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 951643338","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Place of publication not identified","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Analysis 1.","type":"book"},{"id":"teele2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Teele","given":"Dawn Langan"}],"citation-key":"teele2018","container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1086/696621","ISSN":"0022-3816, 1468-2508","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"442-461","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How the West Was Won: Competition, Mobilization, and Women’s Enfranchisement in the United States","title-short":"How the West Was Won","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696621","volume":"80"},{"id":"tempelmaierAustriaBiotechnologyCompanies2020","abstract":"Vienna, December 10, 2020: Austria's biotechnology companies establish BIOTECH AUSTRIA - biotech industry association","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Tempelmaier","given":"Brigitte"}],"citation-key":"tempelmaierAustriaBiotechnologyCompanies2020","container-title":"LISAvienna - life science austria","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en-GB","title":"Austria's biotechnology companies establish BIOTECH AUSTRIA - biotech industry association","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.lisavienna.at/news/austrias-biotechnology-companies-establish-biotech-austria-biotech-industry-association/"},{"id":"tenney2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Tenney","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Das","given":"Dipanjan"},{"family":"Pavlick","given":"Ellie"}],"citation-key":"tenney2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.18653/v1/P19-1452","event-place":"Florence, Italy","event-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"4593-4601","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Florence, Italy","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"BERT Rediscovers the Classical NLP Pipeline","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1452"},{"id":"tenoever2021","abstract":"The Internet architecture is widely perceived as engine for innovation by providing the equal opportunity to deploy new protocols and applications.

I argue that the category, or question, of representation can make sense of theoretical and political debates within poststructuralism in general and poststructuralist political theory in particular. Poststructuralists criticise all forms of presence, whether the presence of the subject, identities or structures. Following poststructuralism, representation can no longer be seen as the reflection of a presence. However, while poststructuralists agree on the turn away from presence, they disagree where to turn and, specifically, on the role and nature of representation. They disagree whether representation is constitutive, and they disagree about how to relate to the hierarchy and violence which, they all agree, is a part of representation. The question of representation may not explain all divisions among poststructuralists, but the question of representation divides poststructuralism in so many ways that it makes sense to analyse the differences among them through the lens of representation. I first look at two issues central to poststructuralism: critique and how to relate to ‘the other’. In the second half of the article, I turn to look at three debates within poststructuralism: immanence versus transcendence, abundance versus lack, and autonomy versus hegemony.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Lasse"}],"citation-key":"thomassen2017","container-title":"Political Studies Review","container-title-short":"Political Studies Review","DOI":"10.1177/1478929917712932","ISSN":"1478-9299, 1478-9302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11]]},"language":"en","page":"539-550","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Poststructuralism and Representation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1478929917712932","volume":"15"},{"id":"thomassen2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomassen","given":"Lasse"}],"citation-key":"thomassen2019","container-title":"New Political Science","container-title-short":"New Political Science","DOI":"10.1080/07393148.2019.1596687","ISSN":"0739-3148, 1469-9931","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"329-344","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Representing the People: Laclau as a Theorist of Representation","title-short":"Representing the People","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07393148.2019.1596687","volume":"41"},{"id":"Thorn2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Thorn","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"Thorn2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,8]]},"title":"The Ethics of AI in Warfare | Lecture - YouTube","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_eNfledjUo"},{"id":"thriftRememberingTechnologicalUnconscious2004","author":[{"family":"Thrift","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"thriftRememberingTechnologicalUnconscious2004","container-title":"Environment and planning D: Society and space","container-title-short":"Environment and planning D: Society and space","ISSN":"0263-7758","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"175-190","title":"Remembering the technological unconscious by foregrounding knowledges of position","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},{"id":"Tienhaara2010","abstract":"The academic literature on international investment treaties, foreign investment contracts and investor-state dispute settlement is dominated by legal analysis.

The aim is to understand how, under the umbrella term of “representation”, French thinkers put into question very basic epistemic assumptions, such as identity, simplicity, unity, subjectivity, objectivity, etc. This paper seeks to understand to which extent the critique of representation leads to a fundamental investigation of the epistemological assumptions of Western thought.","author":[{"literal":"Till Grohmann"}],"citation-key":"tillgrohmann2021","container-title":"Eikasia.

Taking Austria as an example, this article considers some frequent explanations for the transatlantic divide in agricultural biotechnology that emphasize the link between public opinion and policy. Such explanations stress nongovernmental organizations and media campaigns triggering technophobia among an uninformed public, governments giving in to public pressure and abandoning sound science, and protectionism in agricultural policy that prevents free trade. While not entirely to be dismissed, there also are arguments against a cause-effect relationship between public pressure and policy.

It explores ECE populism through Western-developed populism frameworks.

The Gezi Park protests in Turkey allowed studying exactly how a newly created identity –\n              çapulcu\n              identity [Turkish for looters] – can be perceived by the protesters. The present study utilizes a qualitative approach to explore how the\n              çapulcu\n              identity was understood by people who participated in the Gezi Park protests, as well as the norms and prototypes associated with that identity. More specifically, we investigated perceptions of (1) the defining characteristics of a new identity (i.e., meaning of\n              çapulcu\n              ), (2) prototypicality (i.e., typical\n              çapulcu\n              ), (3) expectations of\n              çapulcu\n              behaviour in terms of social norms, and (4) out‐group definitions (i.e., differentiating a\n              çapulcu\n              from a\n              non‐çapulcu\n              ).

More precisely, it refutes two potential criticisms: 1) LD impoverishes the concept of political representation relative to existing representative democracies; 2) LD undermines the centrality of political parties. In answer to (1), the article shows that LD is compatible with a selection model of representation, in which proxies are characterized as gyroscopic representatives, driven by intrinsic motivation and indifferent to sanctions. This claim has far-reaching normative implications for the mandate-independence tradeoff, anti-elitism, and deliberation under LD. With regard to (2), the article examines the function of parties, arguing that, although it puts parties and interest groups on a level playing field, LD does not threaten partisanship, but rather expands the range of potential carriers of partisanship. In addressing these objections, this article demonstrates the democratic credentials of LD, showing that LD is compatible with a high-quality, democratic understanding of representation, which is surrounded by a cluster of thick concepts like commitment, intrinsic motivation, alignment of objectives, sympathy, trust, and dialogue. This turns LD into a powerful instrument for the refurbishment of representation both as a unique mode of political participation and as a practice of self-government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Valsangiacomo","given":"Chiara"}],"citation-key":"valsangiacomo2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Political Science","container-title-short":"Front.

Consequently, current conceptualizations of Internet governance inflate the presence and influence of state actors. Furthermore, they undermine efforts to understand how large-scale distributed systems in the global economy can be governed in the absence of formalized international regimes.

This is because millions of posts generated on one server can easily\"spread\"to another, even if the recipient server has very different moderation policies. An obvious solution would be to leverage moderation tools to automatically tag (and filter) posts that contravene moderation policies, e.g. related to toxic speech. Recent work has exploited the conversational context of a post to improve this automatic tagging, e.g. using the replies to a post to help classify if it contains toxic speech. This has shown particular potential in environments with large training sets that contain complete conversations. This, however, creates challenges in a decentralised context, as a single conversation may be fragmented across multiple servers. Thus, each server only has a partial view of an entire conversation because conversations are often federated across servers in a non-synchronized fashion. To address this, we propose a decentralised conversation-aware content moderation approach suitable for the fediverse. Our approach employs a graph deep learning model (GraphNLI) trained locally on each server. The model exploits local data to train a model that combines post and conversational information captured through random walks to detect toxicity. We evaluate our approach with data from Pleroma, a major decentralised and interoperable micro-blogging network containing 2 million conversations. Our model effectively detects toxicity on larger instances, exclusively trained using their local post information (0.8837 macro-F1). Our approach has considerable scope to improve moderation in decentralised and interoperable social networks such as Pleroma or Mastodon.","author":[{"literal":"Vibhor Agarwal"},{"literal":"Aravindh Raman"},{"literal":"N.

This article explores the case of the ‘Lithium Triangle’, a region of Latin America (spanning Bolivia, Chile and Argentina) that contains the world’s largest reserves, and where environmental conflicts associated with lithium mining have proliferated. Emphasising the centrality of discourse in resource governance, we analyse the discursive strategies employed by institutional actors seeking to promote and render acceptable lithium extraction in the region. We argue that such strategies reproduce imaginaries of prosperity and modernisation long attached to oil and mineral wealth, while at the same time introducing a novel association of mining with high-tech industries, ‘green jobs’ and ‘climate-friendly’ extraction, seeking to obscure the social and ecological costs of lithium production. This inaugurates an era of ‘green extractivism’, whereby intensive resource exploitation is framed not only as compatible with climate change, but indeed as necessary to its mitigation. Our findings contribute to ongoing conversations regarding post-fossil fuel ‘transitions’, by highlighting the contradictory character of mitigation strategies that rely on mineral-intensive development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Voskoboynik","given":"Daniel Macmillen"},{"family":"Andreucci","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"voskoboynik2022","container-title":"Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space","container-title-short":"Environment and Planning E: Nature and Space","DOI":"10.1177/25148486211006345","ISSN":"2514-8486, 2514-8494","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","page":"787-809","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Greening extractivism: Environmental discourses and resource governance in the ‘Lithium Triangle’","title-short":"Greening extractivism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25148486211006345","volume":"5"},{"id":"waelen2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is an upcoming field of research that deals with the ethical assessment of emerging AI applications and addresses the new kinds of moral questions that the advent of AI raises. The argument presented in this article is that, even though there exist different approaches and subfields within the ethics of AI, the field resembles a critical theory. Just like a critical theory, the ethics of AI aims to diagnose as well as change society and is fundamentally concerned with human emancipation and empowerment. This is shown through a power analysis that defines the most commonly addressed ethical principles and topics within the field of AI ethics as either to do with relational power or with dispositional power. Moreover, it is concluded that recognizing AI ethics as a critical theory and borrowing insights from the tradition of critical theory can help the field forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Waelen","given":"Rosalie"}],"citation-key":"waelen2022","container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","container-title-short":"Philos.

Yet evidence about the empirical effects of specific measures remains rare. Using the entire voter roll for the Cape Colony (South Africa) in 1903, which includes the racial classification of each voter, we study two measures introduced by Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes in the 1890s. One of these leveraged socioeconomic inequality and the other human geography to strategically target voters of colour. We estimate that, absent these reforms, the number of voters of colour would have been 50-75% higher at the start of the 20th century, magnitudes that we show could have altered election outcomes. These reforms constituted the basic tools of voter suppression eventually used to achieve mass racial disenfranchisement under apartheid.

In addition to Sunni foreign fighters, Shia fighters from several countries have joined pro-government militias in Syria, leftists have joined Kurdish fighting forces, and private military contractors recruit globally. Estimates of the total number of foreign Sunnis who have fought for the Syrian rebels over the course of the conflict range from 5,000 to over 10,000, while foreign Shia fighters numbered around 10,000 or less in 2013 rising to between 15,000 and 25,000 in 2017.The presence of foreign jihadists, particularly in anti-government groups, steadily grew throughout the Syrian Civil War. In the early insurgency phase mid-2011 to mid-2012, their presence was negligible. In the mid-2012 to late 2013 escalation phase, their numbers grew, but they were still far outnumbered by Syrian resistance fighters (only around twelve hundred foreign anti-government jihadists were killed in Syria in 2013). Throughout 2014, with the rise of the Islamic State, the Al-Nusra Front, and other groups, their numbers drastically increased and they partnered with and absorbed Syrian rebel groups, both jihadist and non-jihadist. By 2015, foreign jihadists outnumbered Syrian jihadists and other rebels in casualty rolls (16,212 anti-government foreign jihadists were killed in 2015 compared to 7,798 Syrian anti-government rebels killed that same year), a trend that carried over into 2016 (13,297 foreign jihadists and 8,170 Syrian rebels), and 2017 (7,494 foreign jihadists and 6,452 Syrian rebels). However, although the numbers of casualties remained high in this phase, arrivals slowed: according to the United States military, foreign fighters coming to Syria and Iraq in 2013-2015 averaged 2,000 fighters per month, but by 2016, this figure had dropped to less than 500 fighters per month and decreasing. By 2018, the proportion of foreign fighters had far decreased (following heavy losses in the bloody battles of 2015-2017 and various interventions by foreign military forces), and Syrian rebels were once again the majority of anti-government casualties (2,746 foreign jihadists killed compared to 5,852 Syrian rebels).According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 65,726 anti-government foreign fighters (almost entirely jihadists) were killed in Syria up to May 2020, constituting nearly half of the 138,202 anti-government fighters killed by that point. Additionally, 10,045 foreign fighters on the side of the Syrian government were killed by then (1,700 Lebanese Hezbollah and 8,345 others, including 2,000+ militiamen of Liwa Fatemiyoun) and 264 Russian soldiers and mercenaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,14]]},"author":[{"literal":"wikipedia"}],"citation-key":"wikipedia2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,16]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1012429255","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Foreign fighters in the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreign_fighters_in_the_Syrian_and_Iraqi_Civil_Wars&oldid=1012429255"},{"id":"wikipedia2023","abstract":"In abstract algebra, a magma, binar, or, rarely, groupoid is a basic kind of algebraic structure.

Acknowledging the value of Landemore’s radical and ambitious proposals, I draw attention to a number of shortcomings and blind spots that have to do with how the case for an ‘open democracy’ is made: through an unduly brief and dismissive treatment of political parties; a methodological insensitivity to empirical variations of democratic performance and citizens’ evaluations of the latter; a failure to distinguish between higher and ordinary law-making in the discussion of the central Icelandic case; and, finally, a surprising concession that realising an open democracy is all but infeasible in established constitutional democracies. If open democracy is to be an attractive ideal, these issues must arguably be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolkenstein","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"wolkenstein2024a","container-title":"Res Publica","container-title-short":"Res Publica","DOI":"10.1007/s11158-023-09626-y","ISSN":"1356-4765, 1572-8692","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"en","page":"161-170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Should Traditional Representative Institutions be Abolished?

What constitutes the Internet has always been an evolving suite of technologies and a dynamic set of social norms, rules, and patterns of use. But the shape and character of digital communications are shifting again—the browser is no longer the primary means by which most people encounter information infrastructure. The bulk of digital communications are no longer between people but between devices, about people, over the Internet of things. Political actors make use of technological proxies in the form of proprietary algorithms and semiautomated social actors—political bots—in subtle attempts to manipulate public opinion. These tools are scaffolding for human control, but the way they work to afford such control over interaction and organization can be unpredictable, even to those who build them. So to understand contemporary political communication—and modern communication broadly—we must now investigate the politics of algorithms and automation.","author":[{"family":"Woolley","given":"Samuel C."},{"family":"Howard","given":"Philip N."}],"citation-key":"Woolley2016","container-title":"International Journal of Communication; Vol 10 (2016)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"Automation, Algorithms, and Politics| Political Communication, Computational Propaganda, and Autonomous Agents — Introduction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/6298"},{"id":"workshop2022","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform new tasks based on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions. While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI

studies on media representations of agricultural biotechnology mostly analyse media texts, this work is intended to fill a research gap with an analysis of journalistic interpretations of media

The purpose of this project was to determine how news media represent agricultural biotechnology and how journalists interpret their own representations. A content and critical discourse analysis of news texts published in the Slovenian media over two years and in-depth interviews with their authors were conducted. News texts results suggest that most of the news posts were “othering” biotechnology and biotechnologists: biotechnology as a science and individual scientists are represented as “they,” who are socially irresponsible, ignorant, arrogant, and “our” enemies who produce unnatural processes and work for biotechnology companies, whose greed is destroying people, animals, and the environment. Most journalists consider these representations to be objective because they have published the biotechnologists’ opinions, despite their own negative attitudes towards biotechnology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zajc","given":"Jožica"},{"family":"Erjavec","given":"Karmen"}],"citation-key":"zajcOtheringAgriculturalBiotechnology2014","container-title":"Public Understanding of Science","container-title-short":"Public Underst Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963662512467412","ISSN":"0963-6625, 1361-6609","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8]]},"language":"en","page":"678-687","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"“Othering” agricultural biotechnology: Slovenian media representation of agricultural biotechnology","title-short":"“Othering” agricultural biotechnology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963662512467412","volume":"23"},{"id":"zarkadakes2020","abstract":"\"Cyber Republic presents a radical framework for rethinking politics and business in a post-work age of human-machine collaboration.

In these instances, a new wave of policy concerns is set forth. This article strives to map out these issues, separating the wheat from the chaff. It aims to provide policy makers and scholars with a comprehensive framework for approaching these thorny issues in their various capacities. To achieve this objective, this article focuses its attention on a general analytical framework, which will be applied to a specific subset of the overall discussion. The analytical framework will reduce the discussion to two dimensions, every one of which addressing two central elements. These four factors call for a distinct discussion, which is at times absent in the existing literature. The two dimensions are (1) the specific and novel problems the process assumedly generates and (2) the specific attributes which exacerbate them. While the problems are articulated in a variety of ways, they most likely could be reduced to two broad categories: efficiency and fairness-based concerns. In the context of this discussion, such problems are usually linked to two salient attributes the algorithmic processes feature?its opaque and automated nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zarsky","given":"Tal"}],"citation-key":"zarsky2015","container-title":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","container-title-short":"Science, Technology, & Human Values","DOI":"10.1177/0162243915605575","ISSN":"0162-2439","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,14]]},"page":"118-132","title":"The Trouble with Algorithmic Decisions: An Analytic Road Map to Examine Efficiency and Fairness in Automated and Opaque Decision Making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0162243915605575","volume":"41"},{"id":"zeppPharmacologicAspectsAntihistamines1975","author":[{"family":"Zepp","given":"E.

Two decades later, it fails any reasonable test of responsible global stewardship of digital information and communications. The abdication of the world’s information spaces to surveillance capitalism has become the meta-crisis of every republic because it obstructs solutions to all other crises. The surveillance capitalist giants–Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and their ecosystems–now constitute a sweeping political-economic institutional order that exerts oligopolistic control over most digital information and communication spaces, systems, and processes.\n            The commodification of human behavior operationalized in the secret massive-scale extraction of human-generated data is the foundation of surveillance capitalism’s two-decade arc of institutional development. However, when revenue derives from commodification of the human, the classic economic equation is scrambled. Imperative economic operations entail accretions of governance functions and impose substantial social harms. Concentration of economic power produces collateral concentrations of governance and social powers. Oligopoly in the economic realm shades into oligarchy in the societal realm. Society’s ability to respond to these developments is thwarted by category errors. Governance incursions and social harms such as control over AI or rampant disinformation are too frequently seen as distinct crises and siloed, each with its own specialists and prescriptions, rather than understood as organic effects of causal economic operations.\n            In contrast, this paper explores surveillance capitalism as a unified field of institutional development. Its four already visible stages of development are examined through a two-decade lens on expanding economic operations and their societal effects, including extraction and the wholesale destruction of privacy, the consequences of blindness-by-design in human-to-human communications, the rise of AI dominance and epistemic inequality, novel achievements in remote behavioral actuation such as the Trump 2016 campaign, and Apple-Google’s leverage of digital infrastructure control to subjugate democratic governments desperate to fight a pandemic. Structurally, each stage creates the conditions and constructs the scaffolding for the next, and each builds on what went before. Substantively, each stage is characterized by three vectors of accomplishment: novel economic operations, governance carve-outs, and fresh social harms. These three dimensions weave together across time in a unified architecture of institutional development. Later-stage harms are revealed as effects of the foundational-stage economic operations required for commodification of the human.\n            Surveillance capitalism’s development is understood in the context of a larger contest with the democratic order—the only competing institutional order that poses an existential threat. The democratic order retains the legitimate authority to contradict, interrupt, and abolish surveillance capitalism’s foundational operations. Its unique advantages include the ability to inspire action and the necessary power to make, impose, and enforce the rule of law. While the liberal democracies have begun to engage with the challenges of regulating today’s privately owned information spaces, I argue that regulation of institutionalized processes that are innately catastrophic for democratic societies cannot produce desired outcomes. The unified field perspective suggests that effective democratic contradiction aimed at eliminating later-stage harms, such as “disinformation,” depends upon the abolition and reinvention of the early-stage economic operations that operationalize the commodification of the human, the source from which such harms originate.\n            The clash of institutional orders is a death match over the politics of knowledge in the digital century. Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic economic imperatives produce a zero-sum dynamic in which the deepening order of surveillance capitalism propagates democratic disorder and deinstitutionalization. Without new public institutions, charters of rights, and legal frameworks purpose-built for a democratic digital century, citizens march naked, easy prey for all who steal and hunt with human data. Only one of these contesting orders will emerge with the authority and power to rule, while the other will drift into deinstitutionalization, its functions absorbed by the victor. Will these contradictions ultimately defeat surveillance capitalism, or will democracy suffer the greater injury? It is possible to have surveillance capitalism, and it is possible to have a democracy. It is not possible to have both.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuboff","given":"Shoshana"}],"citation-key":"zuboff2022","container-title":"Organization Theory","container-title-short":"Organization Theory","DOI":"10.1177/26317877221129290","ISSN":"2631-7877, 2631-7877","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"263178772211292","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Surveillance Capitalism or Democracy?

Given its tripartite formulation, the collapse of these distinctions into a binary “trustee/delegate” formulation obscures a more complex political landscape with eight—rather than two—ideal types. Furthermore, once unpacked, we can see that the distinctions operate entirely independent of the location of authority, leading to the seemingly paradoxical\n              instructed\n              trustees and\n              independent\n              delegates. I also claim that the three distinctions apply to any decision maker, and thus, the attribution of this problem as distinctive of democratic political representation is an important overstatement. The article thus contributes to a more general theory of political representation that can be applied in nonelectoral and nondemocratic contexts increasingly relevant to global politics.","container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055409090261","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Am Polit Sci Rev","language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"214-230","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Representation Rethought: On Trustees, Delegates, and Gyroscopes in the Study of Political Representation and Democracy","title-short":"Representation Rethought","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003055409090261/type/journal_article","volume":"103","author":[{"family":"Rehfeld","given":"Andrew"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"citation-key":"rehfeld2009a","library":"My Library","citekey":"rehfeld2009a"},{"id":"ak2023","type":"article-journal","language":"de","source":"Zotero","title":"Psychische Belastungen evaluieren","URL":"https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/service/broschueren/ArbeitnehmerInnenschutz/broschueren/Evaluierung_psychischer_Belastungen.html","author":[{"family":"AK","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"citation-key":"ak2023","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ak2023"},{"id":"hoffmann2014","type":"report","title":"Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologinnen","author":[{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kallus","given":"Wolfgang"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"citation-key":"hoffmann2014","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"hoffmann2014"},{"id":"oegb2024","type":"webpage","abstract":"Der ÖGB liefert Antworten auf die wichtigsten Fragen rund um Berufskrankheiten","language":"de-AT","title":"Berufskrankheiten: Wenn die Arbeit krank macht","URL":"https://www.oegb.at/berufskrankheit","author":[{"family":"ÖGB","given":""}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,21]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"oegb2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"oegb2024"},{"id":"ak2022","type":"report","title":"Stress.

Transformative impacts on many sectors are inevitable, and manufacturing is not an exception. Many studies have investigated solutions that focus on diverse directions, with urban production being the focus of many research efforts and recent studies concentrating on Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing technologies. This study investigated the integration of smart factory technologies with urban manufacturing as a solution for the aforementioned megatrends. A literature review on related ﬁelds, mass personalization, sustainable manufacturing, urban factory, and smart factory was conducted to analyze the beneﬁts, challenges, and correlations. In addition, applications of smart factory technologies in urban production with several case studies are summarized from the literature review. The integration of smart factory technologies and urban manufacturing is proposed as the urban smart factory which has three major characteristics, human-centric, sustainable, and resilient. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no such deﬁnition has been proposed before. Practitioners could use the conceptual deﬁnition of an urban smart factory presented in this study as a reference model for enhancement of urban production while academics could beneﬁt from the mentioned future research directions.","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su14031221","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Sustainability","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1221","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Conceptual Definition and Future Directions of Urban Smart Factory for Sustainable Manufacturing","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/3/1221","volume":"14","author":[{"family":"Sajadieh","given":"Seyed Mohammad Mehdi"},{"family":"Son","given":"Yoo Ho"},{"family":"Noh","given":"Sang Do"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,31]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"citation-key":"sajadieh2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"sajadieh2022"},{"id":"ijassi2022","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Urban factories seem to be a promising approach to satisfy the needs of a population in urban areas and to create a close proximity with local stakeholders (customers, workforce, potential service suppliers, etc.). This paper presents a state of the art on urban factories to explore the various definitions of the concept and to identify the current gaps in the literature. Indeed, various types of urban factories have been characterized with various levels of urbanity, motivations and value chains. From this review, the authors propose a new typology of urban factories with different value chain profiles. This would be the initial step for implementing urban factories at the product and process design stage according to the profile of the value chain. The outcomes of this study are a list of definitions and case studies that will help cover the literature gap, and a preliminary projection into the design level. The discussion highlights the advantages and challenges of urban factories, and explores the sustainability aspect in the presented typology. The emergence of this type of urban factories requires both investment in innovative mobility and construction concepts, and the city’s administrative support.","container-title":"Procedia CIRP","DOI":"10.1016/j.procir.2022.02.048","ISSN":"22128271","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia CIRP","language":"en","page":"290-295","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characterizing urban factories by their value chain: a first step towards more sustainability in production","title-short":"Characterizing urban factories by their value chain","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212827122000488","volume":"105","author":[{"family":"Ijassi","given":"Walid"},{"family":"Evrard","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Zwolinski","given":"Peggy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,31]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"citation-key":"ijassi2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ijassi2022"},{"id":"aragon","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Manufacturing quality today: Higher quality output, lower cost of quality","author":[{"family":"Aragon","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Makarova","given":"Evgeniya"},{"family":"Ragani","given":"Alessandro Faure"},{"family":"Rutten","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"aragon","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"aragon"},{"id":"bauman2000","type":"book","call-number":"HN17.5 .B36 2000","event-place":"Cambridge, UK : Malden, MA","ISBN":"978-0-7456-2409-9","note":"OCLC: ocm44157073","number-of-pages":"228","publisher":"Polity Press ; Blackwell","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK : Malden, MA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Liquid modernity","author":[{"family":"Bauman","given":"Zygmunt"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"citation-key":"bauman2000","library":"My Library","citekey":"bauman2000"},{"id":"foucault2008","type":"book","call-number":"JC574 .F68 2008","event-place":"Basingstoke [England] ; New York","ISBN":"978-1-4039-8654-2","language":"eng","note":"OCLC: ocn214282391","number-of-pages":"346","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"Basingstoke [England] ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The birth of biopolitics: lectures at the Collège de France, 1978-79","title-short":"The birth of biopolitics","author":[{"family":"Foucault","given":"Michel"}],"editor":[{"family":"Senellart","given":"Michel"}],"contributor":[{"family":"Collège de France","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"citation-key":"foucault2008","library":"My Library","citekey":"foucault2008"},{"id":"fischer","type":"article-journal","language":"de","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Einfu¨hrung in das mathematische Arbeiten","author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Ilse"}],"citation-key":"fischer","library":"My Library","citekey":"fischer"},{"id":"caluya2010","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Social Identities","DOI":"10.1080/13504630.2010.509565","ISSN":"1350-4630","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Social Identities","page":"621-633","title":"The post-panoptic society?

The way food is consumed and produced affects the human well-being as well as the environment. Avoiding food losses and adopting a balanced healthy diet is also an important step towards sustain ability. Promoting dietary standards and monitoring their adoption is a potentially important policy tool for mitigating environmental impacts of food production as well as monitoring food security and nutrition. There is relatively little research to measure nutritional adequacy of food intake according to dietary standards, and to explore the relationship with health outcomes. In this study we choose the well-established WHO global-level dietary recommendations as a reference to quantify nutritional adequacy by developing an energy and macronutrient intake index (ENI), and to assess its relation to indicators of hunger and undernutrition. We find strong negative association between nutritional adequacy of dietary intake and prevalence of undernutrition at national level, and we illustrate that ENI could be an effective tool to inform national food security strategies. Under different future socioeconomic development scenarios, almost all sub-Saharan African countries achieve an adequate per capita energy intake level but their nutritional status varies with many countries deviating from recommended levels because of the unbalanced development of macronutrient intake levels; more improvement exists in fat and energy intake levels and less agreement in fruit-vegetable and animal protein intake levels. Scenario application proves that the relationship between ENI and undernutrition could readily be applied in future scenarios generated by integrated assessment models to provide insights into the impacts of various climate change scenarios, socioeconomic development pathways and alternative global trade policies on global hunger and undernutrition status.

Here, an all-optical method is presented, which enables unprecedented tracking of the ultrafast dynamics of spin-to-charge conversion in a prototypical topological insulator Bi2Se3/ferromagnetic Co heterostructure, down to the sub-picosecond timescale. Compared to pure Bi2Se3 or Co, a giant terahertz emission is observed in the heterostructure that originates from spin-to-charge conversion, in which the topological surface states play a crucial role. A 0.12 ps timescale is identified that sets a technological speed limit of spin-to-charge conversion processes in topological insulators. In addition, it is shown that the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency is temperature independent in Bi2Se3 as expected from the nature of the surface states, paving the way for designing next-generation high-speed optospintronic devices based on topological insulators at room temperature.","container-title":"ADVANCED MATERIALS","DOI":"{10.1002/adma.201802356}","ISSN":"0935-9648","issue":"52","language":"English","note":"tex.address: POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY\ntex.affiliation: Chia, EEM (Reprint Author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Div Phys & Appl Phys, 21 Nanyang Link, Singapore 637371, Singapore.

We also demonstrate that the same strategy can be used to produce orthorhombic SnSe nanostructures and nanomaterials. NPLs are grown through a screw dislocation-driven mechanism. This mechanism typically results in pyramidal structures, but we demonstrate here that the growth from multiple dislocations results in flower-like structures. Crystallographically textured SnSe2 bulk nanomaterials obtained from the hot pressing of these SnSe2 structures display highly anisotropic charge and heat transport properties and thermoelectric (TE) figures of merit limited by relatively low electrical conductivities. To improve this parameter, SnSe2 NPLs are blended here with metal nanoparticles. The electrical conductivities of the blends are significantly improved with respect to bare SnSe2 NPLs, what translates into a three-fold increase of the TE Figure of merit, reaching unprecedented ZT values up to 0.65.","container-title":"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION","DOI":"{10.1002/anie.201809847}","ISSN":"1433-7851","issue":"52","language":"English","note":"tex.address: POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY\ntex.affiliation: Cabot, A (Reprint Author), Catalonia Energy Res Inst IREC, Barcelona 08930, Spain.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.1706.03762","license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","note":"publisher: arXiv\nversion: 7","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Attention Is All You Need","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762","author":[{"family":"Vaswani","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Uszkoreit","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Llion"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Aidan N."},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Lukasz"},{"family":"Polosukhin","given":"Illia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"citation-key":"vaswani2017a","library":"My Library","citekey":"vaswani2017a"},{"id":"bender2021b","type":"paper-conference","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3442188.3445922","event-place":"Virtual Event Canada","event-title":"FAccT '21: 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8309-7","language":"en","page":"610-623","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Virtual Event Canada","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜","title-short":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922","author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,3]]},"citation-key":"bender2021b","library":"My Library","citekey":"bender2021b"},{"id":"haxeltine2017","type":"article-journal","container-title":"European Public & Social Innovation Review","DOI":"10.31637/epsir.17-1.5","ISSN":"25299824","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"EPSIR","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Building a middle-range theory of Transformative Social Innovation; theoretical pitfalls and methodological responses","URL":"http://pub.sinnergiak.org/index.php/esir/article/view/51","volume":"2","author":[{"family":"Haxeltine","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Pel","given":"Bonno"},{"family":"Wittmayer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Dumitru","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Avelino","given":"Flor"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"citation-key":"haxeltine2017","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"haxeltine2017"},{"id":"sabl2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Empirical political scientists and normative political theorists both seek to assess the quality of democracy. But they apply to this task very different criteria and assumptions. Empiricists (in particular those who study American politics) often assume that a—perhaps\n              the\n              —key indicator of democratic quality is responsiveness, the degree to which policy outcomes reflect public opinion. They often cite “democratic theory” as endorsing this criterion. Normative theorists, however, all but universally reject responsiveness, proposing instead very different criteria of democratic quality. I document a divide between two research cultures; trace some of its causes; and suggest some ways of overcoming it so that scholars on each side may benefit from the insights of the other. Empiricists, I argue, should acknowledge that the responsiveness criterion is neither value-neutral nor, in its pure form, particularly persuasive. Theorists adduce other criteria for sound and commonsensical reasons. In particular, to the extent that empiricists find that policy outcomes reflect not median voter preferences but either random factors or the concerns of the wealthy and organized, they would render their findings more compelling by presenting them as troubling according to a variety of persuasive democratic theories, not just a stylized theory that posits pure responsiveness as its ideal. Normative theorists, I argue, may learn from empiricists greater respect for ordinary citizens’ existing opinions, however imperfect the social and political circumstances in which they originate. and greater concern regarding empirical evidence that the median voter’s opinions may have little independent effect on policy. In spite of all this, the two cultures remain properly distinct in many respects. Some substantial differences in approach reflect a necessary, permanent, and salutary division of labor between two very different modes of studying democracy and assessing its quality.","container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592715000079","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Perspect. polit.","language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"345-365","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Two Cultures of Democratic Theory: Responsiveness, Democratic Quality, and the Empirical-Normative Divide","title-short":"The Two Cultures of Democratic Theory","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1537592715000079/type/journal_article","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Sabl","given":"Andrew"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"citation-key":"sabl2015","library":"My Library","citekey":"sabl2015"},{"id":"andrewsabl","type":"article-journal","abstract":"For the last fifteen years or so, an emerging “realist” school of political theory, questioning not only the conclusions of mainstream moral and political philosophy but also, more fundamentally, the questions it asks, has called for a new approach.1 Rather than deducing moral principles from posited moral ideals, realists aspire to draw normative recommendations from reflections on actual political events and institutions, and from judgments regarding which institutions and practices do better at addressing recurrent problems. Stressing the ubiquity of moral disagreement and the permanence of political conflict – politics is a contest among adversaries, not a reasonable conversation among friends – realists see politics not as a quest for rational consensus but as a set of technologies for ensuring order and providing public goods in spite of the lack of such consensus. Rather than political morality being an instance of “applied ethics” in which the same moral principles we use in private life can be urged upon political life, politics, realists insist, embodies its own characteristic values.","container-title":"The Cambridge Companion to Civil Disobedience","DOI":"10.1017/9781108775748.007","note":"DOI: 10.1017/9781108775748.007\nMAG ID: 4235434337\nS2ID: c91c59b656b7e5ab21af371190bc141c90ae0bfb","title":"Realist Disobedience","author":[{"literal":"Andrew Sabl"},{"literal":"Andrew Sabl"}],"citation-key":"andrewsabl","library":"My Library","citekey":"andrewsabl"},{"id":"jordan2015a","type":"article-journal","container-title":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biu217","ISSN":"1525-3244, 0006-3568","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"208-211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Citizen Science as a Distinct Field of Inquiry","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/65/2/208/243853/Citizen-Science-as-a-Distinct-Field-of-Inquiry","volume":"65","author":[{"family":"Jordan","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Crall","given":"Alycia"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Mellor","given":"David"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,1]]},"citation-key":"jordan2015a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"jordan2015a"},{"id":"giardullo2023a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Citizen Science is believed to contribute significantly to the democratisation of science, engaging non-scientists in scientific research.

A crucial step in this direction is the formulation and analysis of models of autopoietic systems. This article sketches the beginnings of such a project by examining a glider from Conway's game of life in autopoietic terms.

This paper will explore the environmental value and impact of makers' innovative business model and discuss on how to increase the circularity. At the same time, we will describe the role of maker communities and how to help to play a better role. In the framework of a case study analysis based on 10 different Maker initiatives across Europe, 39 interviews were conducted with makers and Maker initiatives managers evaluating core questions such as potential environmental value and impact, value chains, and energy efficient behaviours.

Synthesizing these cases, we found these organizations applied systems thinking to reframe their product and service offerings and developed material circular flows in their business models. Analysis of how our exemplar organizations changed their business models to tackle pressing sustainability issues and to resolve the burden–resource tension show that the focus of change is on reconceptualizing their understanding of the role of waste in the value chain of their products and services.

We analyse a European Commission survey conducted in 2016 among approximately 11,000 firms in EU‐28 member states in order to throw light on the conditions in which SMEs engage in five specific CE activities. In contrast to previous studies arguing that CE activities are independent of each other, we present novel findings demonstrating that seven patterns of engagement in CE can be identified in which activities are systematically interdependent. Further, we show that these patterns are associated with the organizational properties of SMEs and are differentially distributed among EU member states and industrial sectors. The interdependency of activities forms a hierarchy in which waste minimization is the most likely activity to be implemented in SMEs, followed, in descending order of likelihood, by replanning of energy use, redesigning products and services, and finally using renewable energy and replanning water usage. The findings have theoretical, managerial, and policy implications for the adoption of interdependent CE activities.","container-title":"Business Strategy and the Environment","DOI":"10.1002/bse.2259","ISSN":"0964-4733, 1099-0836","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Bus Strat Env","language":"en","page":"485-496","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping circular economy activities in the European Union: Patterns of implementation and their correlates in small and medium‐sized enterprises","title-short":"Mapping circular economy activities in the European Union","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.2259","volume":"28","author":[{"family":"Katz‐Gerro","given":"Tally"},{"family":"López Sintas","given":"Jordi"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"citation-key":"katz-gerro2019","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"katz-gerro2019"},{"id":"dossantos2021","type":"chapter","abstract":"Abstract\n            This chapter presents Distributed Economies (DE) as a promising model for locally-based sustainability.

The consequences of this shaping into acceptable meaning is argued to result in semantic subspaces. These semantic subspaces are presented as the restricted lexical possibilities of human-machine dialogic interaction, and their consequences are discussed.","container-title":"A Peer-Reviewed Journal About","DOI":"10.7146/aprja.v13i1.151234","ISSN":"2245-7755","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"APRJA","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0","page":"90-104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Shaping Vectors: Discipline and Control in Word Embeddings","title-short":"Shaping Vectors","URL":"https://aprja.net//article/view/151234","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Depaz","given":"Pierre"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"citation-key":"depaz2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"depaz2024"},{"id":"vanheerden2019","type":"book","call-number":"194","collection-title":"Deleuze connections","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-1-4744-3907-7","language":"eng","publisher":"Edinburgh university press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Deleuze and anarchism","author":[{"family":"Van Heerden","given":"Chantelle"},{"family":"Eloff","given":"Aragorn"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"citation-key":"vanheerden2019","library":"My Library","citekey":"vanheerden2019"},{"id":"damato2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Motivated by the question of responsible AI and value alignment, I seek to offer a uniquely Foucauldian reconstruction of the problem as the emergence of an ethical subject in a disciplinary setting. This reconstruction contrasts with the strictly human-oriented programme typical to current scholarship that often views technology in instrumental terms. With this in mind, I problematise the concept of a technological subjectivity through an exploration of various aspects of ChatGPT in light of Foucault’s work, arguing that current systems lack the reflexivity and self-formative characteristics inherent in the notion of the subject. By drawing upon a recent dialogue between Foucault and phenomenology, I suggest four techno-philosophical desiderata that would address the gaps in this search for a technological subjectivity:\n              embodied self-care, embodied intentionality, imagination and reflexivity\n              . Thus I propose that advanced AI be reconceptualised as a subject capable of “technical” self-crafting and reflexive self-conduct, opening new pathways to grasp the intertwinement of the human and the artificial. This reconceptualisation holds the potential to render future AI technology more transparent and responsible in the circulation of knowledge, care and power.","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-024-01898-z","ISSN":"0951-5666, 1435-5655","journalAbbreviation":"AI & Soc","language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ChatGPT: towards AI subjectivity","title-short":"ChatGPT","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-024-01898-z","author":[{"family":"D’Amato","given":"Kristian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"citation-key":"damato2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"damato2024"},{"id":"ohalloran2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            I demonstrate an approach fostering inventive interpretation of short stories in Literary Studies and higher education generally. It involves constructing an ‘assemblage’—at its simplest, an evolving network of unusual connections for creative outcome. The assemblage of this article combines freshly located research literature, directly and indirectly related to a story’s themes, and/or the personality type of protagonists. Importantly, this assemblage also utilizes text analysis software revealing the relatively invisible (e.g. (in)frequent words, parts of speech, and topics) and Large Language Model (LLM) Generative AI to enrich the interpretation. The use of all these elements helps productively exceed initial intuitions about the story, facilitating creativity. I model the approach using Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, The Black Cat, whose protagonist is a homicidal psychopath. Specifically, the assemblage here includes relevant software-based research (a corpus analysis of homicidal psychopathic language), non-software-based research (psychoanalytical literary criticism of The Black Cat using the empirically validated concept of transference), text analysis software (WMatrix and Datayze), and the LLM Generative AI, ‘ChatGPT’ (using the freely available LLM GPT-3.5). One use of this approach is as a pedagogy in Literary Studies employing text analysis software (e.g. on a digital stylistics course). Yet given creative adaptability is a key 21st-century skill, with digital literacy—including the use of Generative AI—an important contemporary competence, and with the short story genre universally known, I highlight too the utility of this approach as a university-wide pedagogy for enhancing creative thinking.","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqad050","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"2","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"657-689","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital assemblages with AI for creative interpretation of short stories","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/39/2/657/7623477","volume":"39","author":[{"family":"O'Halloran","given":"Kieran"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"citation-key":"ohalloran2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"ohalloran2024"},{"id":"maas","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Deconstructing Transformers","author":[{"family":"Maas","given":"Wouter"}],"citation-key":"maas","library":"My Library","citekey":"maas"},{"id":"heinlein2024","type":"book","edition":"1st ed. 2024","event-place":"Wiesbaden","ISBN":"978-3-658-45707-5","language":"eng","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-45708-2","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Artificial Intelligence in Society: Social, Political and Cultural Implications of a Technological Innovation","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence in Society","editor":[{"family":"Heinlein","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Huchler","given":"Norbert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"heinlein2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"heinlein2024"},{"id":"canes-wrone2004","type":"article-journal","abstract":"How does public opinion affect presidential policymaking? We address this issue by testing a diverse set of hypotheses with data concerning a set of individual policies across time.

The analysis suggests that presidents are more responsive to mass opinion on issues that are familiar to citizens in their everyday lives. Also, for reelection‐seeking presidents, responsiveness is shown to depend upon two key political factors. First, presidents are more responsive to public opinion when the next election is imminent. Second, the effect of presidential popularity is nonmonotonic; presidents with average approval ratings are most likely to adopt policy positions congruent with public opinion, whereas presidents with approval ratings that are significantly above or below average have the greatest propensity to take unpopular positions.","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00096.x","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"American J Political Sci","language":"en","page":"690-706","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Conditional Nature of Presidential Responsiveness to Public Opinion","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00096.x","volume":"48","author":[{"family":"Canes‐Wrone","given":"Brandice"},{"family":"Shotts","given":"Kenneth W."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10]]},"citation-key":"canes-wrone2004","library":"My Library","citekey":"canes-wrone2004"},{"id":"elling1982","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Legislative Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.2307/439692","ISSN":"03629805","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Legislative Studies Quarterly","license":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1","page":"75","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ideological Change in the U.

Here we describe a series of surveys and experiments that point to an intriguing explanation for this pattern that runs contrary to standard political science explanations, but one that accords with a large psychological literature. Voters, we find, actually intend to judge presidents on cumulative growth. However, since that characteristic is not readily available to them, voters inadvertently substitute election‐year performance because it is more easily accessible. This “end‐heuristic” explanation for voters’ election‐year emphasis reflects a general tendency for people to simplify retrospective assessments by substituting conditions at the end for the whole. The end‐heuristic explanation also suggests a remedy, a way to align voters’ actions with their intentions. Providing people with the attribute they are seeking—cumulative growth—eliminates the election‐year emphasis.","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12053","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"American J Political Sci","language":"en","page":"31-47","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Substituting the End for the Whole: Why Voters Respond Primarily to the Election‐Year Economy","title-short":"Substituting the End for the Whole","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12053","volume":"58","author":[{"family":"Healy","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Lenz","given":"Gabriel S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1]]},"citation-key":"healy2014","library":"My Library","citekey":"healy2014"},{"id":"afscharian2024","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"Grand promises of a “strong social Europe” have given way to a sidelined agenda.","language":"en-GB","note":"section: Politics","title":"The vanishing act of Social Europe: Will it rise again?","title-short":"The vanishing act of Social Europe","URL":"https://www.socialeurope.eu/the-vanishing-act-of-social-europe-will-it-rise-again","author":[{"family":"Afscharian","given":"Dominic"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,16]]},"citation-key":"afscharian2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"afscharian2024"},{"id":"zwysen2024b","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"Concentrated labour markets and non-compete agreements erode worker bargaining power.","language":"en-GB","note":"section: Economy","title":"Limited options to change employers keep wages low","URL":"https://www.socialeurope.eu/limited-options-to-change-employers-keep-wages-low","author":[{"family":"Zwysen","given":"Wouter"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"citation-key":"zwysen2024b","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"zwysen2024b"},{"id":"prinsloo2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In the socio-technical imaginary of higher education, algorithmic decision-making offers huge potential, but we also cannot deny the risks and ethical concerns.

In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions.

However, the way AI is developed and deployed for a great part determines how AI will impact our lives and societies. For instance, automated classification systems can deliver prejudiced results and therefore raise questions about privacy and bias; and, the autonomy of intelligent systems, such as, e.g. self-driving vehicles, raises concerns about safety and responsibility. AI’s impact concerns not only the research and development directions for AI, but also how these systems are introduced into society and used in everyday situations. There is a large debate concerning how the use of AI will influence labour, well-being, social interactions, health care, income distribution and other social areas. Dealing with these issues requires that ethical, legal, societal and economic implications are taken into account. In this paper, I will discuss how a responsible approach to the development and use of AI can be achieved, and how current approaches to ensure the ethical alignment of decisions made or supported by AI systems can benefit from the social perspective embedded in non-Western philosophies, in particular the Ubuntu philosophy.","container-title":"Responsible AI in Africa","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-08214-6","language":"en","note":"collection-title: Social and Cultural Studies of Robots and AI\nDOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-08215-3_9","page":"195-214","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Recommendations and Lessons Learned","title-short":"Responsible Artificial Intelligence","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-08215-3_9","editor":[{"family":"Eke","given":"Damian Okaibedi"},{"family":"Wakunuma","given":"Kutoma"},{"family":"Akintoye","given":"Simisola"}],"author":[{"family":"Dignum","given":"Virginia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"citation-key":"dignum2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"dignum2023"},{"id":"hudson2023","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              This paper addresses the gap between familiar popular narratives describing Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as the trope of the killer robot, and the realistic near-future implications of machine intelligence and automation for technology policy and society. The authors conducted a series of interviews with technologists, science fiction writers, and other experts, as well as a workshop, to identify a set of key themes relevant to the near future of AI. In parallel, they led the analysis of almost 100 recent works of science fiction stories with AI themes to develop a preliminary taxonomy of AI in science fiction.

However, our findings also suggest more productive avenues of inquiry and framing that could foster both better policy and better narratives around AI.","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-021-01273-2","ISSN":"0951-5666, 1435-5655","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"AI & Soc","language":"en","page":"197-211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What can science fiction tell us about the future of artificial intelligence policy?","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-021-01273-2","volume":"38","author":[{"family":"Hudson","given":"Andrew Dana"},{"family":"Finn","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Wylie","given":"Ruth"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"citation-key":"hudson2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"hudson2023"},{"id":"brevini2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The Black Box Society was one of first scholarly accounts to propose a social theory of the use of data in constructing personal reputations, new media audiences, and financial power, by illuminating recurrent patterns of power and exploitation in the digital economy. While many corporations have a direct window into our lives through constant, ubiquitous data collection, our knowledge of their inner workings is often partial and incomplete. Closely guarded by private companies and inaccessible to most researchers or the broader public, too much algorithmic decision-making remains a black box to this day. Much has happened since 2015 that vindicates and challenges the book’s main themes. To answer many of the concerns raised in the volume in light of the most recent developments, we have brought together leading thinkers who have explored the interplay of politics, economics, and culture in domains ordered algorithmically by managers, bureaucrats, and technology workers. While the contributions are diverse, a unifying theme animates them. Each offers a sophisticated critique of the interplay between state and market forces in building or eroding the many layers of our common lives, as well as the privatization of spheres of reputation, search, and finance. Unsatisfied with narrow methodologies of economics or political science, they advance politico-economic analysis. They therefore succeed in unveiling the foundational role that the turn to big data has in organizing economic and social relations.","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951720935146","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Big Data & Society","language":"en","page":"2053951720935146","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Revisiting the Black Box Society by rethinking the political economy of big data","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951720935146","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Brevini","given":"Benedetta"},{"family":"Pasquale","given":"Frank"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"citation-key":"brevini2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"brevini2020"},{"id":"musagiuliano2020","type":"article-journal","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-020-00966-4","ISSN":"0951-5666, 1435-5655","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"AI & Soc","language":"en","page":"1009-1024","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Echoes of myth and magic in the language of Artificial Intelligence","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-020-00966-4","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Musa Giuliano","given":"Roberto"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"citation-key":"musagiuliano2020","library":"My Library","citekey":"musagiuliano2020"},{"id":"falk2021","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1080/03080188.2020.1840219","ISSN":"0308-0188, 1743-2790","issue":"1-2","journalAbbreviation":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","language":"en","page":"36-52","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Artificial stupidity","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1080/03080188.2020.1840219","volume":"46","author":[{"family":"Falk","given":"Michael"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,3]]},"citation-key":"falk2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"falk2021"},{"id":"grillitsch2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Non-metropolitan regions are considered more exposed to external shocks than their metropolitan counterparts, while having lower capacities to change.

We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2402.05668","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","note":"version: 2","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05668","author":[{"family":"Chu","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yugeng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ziqing"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xinyue"},{"family":"Backes","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yang"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"chu2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"chu2024"},{"id":"zhuo2023","type":"article","abstract":"Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications.

Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is little systematic examination and user study of the risks and harmful behaviors of current LLM usage. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method called ``red teaming'' on OpenAI's ChatGPT\\footnote{In this paper, ChatGPT refers to the version released on Dec 15th.} to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \\textit{Bias} 2) \\textit{Reliability} 3) \\textit{Robustness} 4) \\textit{Toxicity}. In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We find that a significant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies.

Rather than weighing in on the potential impact of GenAI, this paper engages with the implicit sociotechnical imaginaries underpinning reactions to GenAI. One particularly evocative source for sociotechnical imaginaries are fictional texts, which can shape our shared imagination of possible and probable futures. Accordingly, I analyze two seminal works of fiction: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (Planet eBooks, 1818) and Franz Kafka’s The Trial (Echo Library, 1925). Frankenstein is regarded as an enduring myth that has shaped perceptions of artificial life. This paper sets out to explore the limitations of the ‘Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary’ by unpacking AI’s assumed modes of meaning-making along three axes: (1) agency, (2) relations, and (3) control. Within the Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary, AI is approached in anthropomorphic terms, emphasizing the struggle over control of meaning-making without reshaping its overarching logic. The Trial, in contrast, offers a lens that challenges common dichotomies underpinning the Frankenstein model: (1) highlighting the entanglement between AI and human intentionality in processes of meaning-making, (2) exploring human-AI relations as recursively shaped through the complementary tendency of humans and GenAI to generate and infer meaning, and (3) shifting the notion of control from a struggle over domination to an emphasis on how GenAI concurrently expands the available choices while limiting humans’ influence over patterns of meaning-making.","container-title":"Postdigital Science and Education","DOI":"10.1007/s42438-024-00482-4","ISSN":"2524-485X, 2524-4868","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Postdigit Sci Educ","language":"en","page":"962-977","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Monsters to Mazes: Sociotechnical Imaginaries of AI Between Frankenstein and Kafka","title-short":"From Monsters to Mazes","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42438-024-00482-4","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Dishon","given":"Gideon"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9]]},"citation-key":"dishon2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"dishon2024"},{"id":"kordel2024","type":"book","abstract":"This handbook is designed as a toolbox for applied and practice-orientated migration and integration research.

Accordingly, this article contributes to the growing literature on the dynamics of social innovation initiatives by investigating how rural areas and their communities are communicatively re‐constructed, as part of socio‐spatial processes emerging from the work of rural development initiatives, fostering potential social change towards more sustainable societies. Building on fieldwork from the rural Austrian region of Mühlviertel, it is shown how social innovation aiming at instigating positive territorial developments is linked to intertwined processes of the re‐figuration of social bonds and re‐figuration of space, which is centred around the propagation of regional ‘community of values’ founded on ideas about changing values and social sustainability.","container-title":"Sociologia Ruralis","DOI":"10.1111/soru.12496","ISSN":"0038-0199, 1467-9523","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Sociologia Ruralis","language":"en","page":"e12496","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rural development as the propagation of regional ‘communities of values’: A case study of local discourses promoting social innovation and social sustainability","title-short":"Rural development as the propagation of regional ‘communities of values’","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soru.12496","volume":"65","author":[{"family":"Stoustrup","given":"Sune Wiingaard"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"citation-key":"stoustrup2025","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"stoustrup2025"},{"id":"ammaturo2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Social innovation has been associated with contributing to ‘valuable’ rural development; however, usually, the impact of social innovation has been identified in the aftermath of its development or implementation. This might be too narrow an approach, as an ongoing social innovation process in itself may already lead to effects that contribute to regional and social changes in a local community and beyond. This paper argues that collaborative valuation processes are embedded in social innovation processes, generating effects that contribute to rural development. Focusing on a case study that exemplifies social innovation processes in agriculture and food production carried out by a rural collaborative community in southern Italy, we demonstrate how three valuation phases, such as contestations and negotiations of norms, symbolic capital accumulation and recognition of actions, as well as re-definitions of values, impact community development through joint sense-making, empowerment and societal change. Our empirical results suggest the close intertwining of both social innovation and valuation processes. The empirical results demonstrate how collective valuation processes have micro-effects on the agro-economic system, on local socio-cultural processes, and on place-making activities. Methodologically, this paper builds on ethnographic methods, including participatory observations, semi-structured interviews, oral histories, and socio-spatial analysis investigating moments of valuation embedded in daily collaborative practices.","container-title":"Societies","DOI":"10.3390/soc14060076","ISSN":"2075-4698","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Societies","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"76","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Valuation in Rural Social Innovation Processes—Analysing Micro-Impact of a Collaborative Community in Southern Italy","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/14/6/76","volume":"14","author":[{"family":"Ammaturo","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Suntje"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"citation-key":"ammaturo2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ammaturo2024"},{"id":"rado2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Purpose\n              This paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of philosophies underpinning social innovation based on the action research strategies applied in the field.\n            \n            \n              Design/methodology/approach\n              Literature review was conducted to identify action research strategies referred to in the social innovation literature.

One response is residents leaving their communities. However, there are also many empirical examples of residents staying, launching project initiatives, developing new solutions and experimenting with new practices. This is what we call social innovation. What experiences do actors have in these processes? Can we speak of empowerment? To what extent can such initiatives have an impact on community development? In this article, we explore these questions, for which there is little related empirical research. By applying a multi-sited individualising comparison to case studies in three European countries (Germany, Ireland and Portugal), we obtain empirical evidence of the following dimensions of empowerment that Avelino et al. outline conceptually: the achievement of autonomy, competence and relatedness and also impact, meaning and resilience. Often, however, it is not the individual actors for whom such effects can be reported. Rather, the social initiative as such or the local administration has acquired new skills and autonomy. Regarding community development, ‘pathways to impact’, such as infrastructure improvements and/or the creation of new employment opportunities and/or the influx of new residents, could be identified. However, this development often depended on both opportunity and the cooperation and goodwill of many stakeholders.","container-title":"Societies","DOI":"10.3390/soc14050058","ISSN":"2075-4698","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Societies","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Socially Innovative Initiatives in Deprived Rural Areas of Germany, Ireland and Portugal: Exploring Empowerment and Impact on Community Development","title-short":"Socially Innovative Initiatives in Deprived Rural Areas of Germany, Ireland and Portugal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/14/5/58","volume":"14","author":[{"family":"Christmann","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Sept","given":"Ariane"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Ralph"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,28]]},"citation-key":"christmann2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"christmann2024"},{"id":"wilken2024","type":"book","collection-title":"Research in Social Work Series","edition":"1st ed","event-place":"Bristol","ISBN":"978-1-4473-6932-5","language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Policy Press","publisher-place":"Bristol","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Social Work and Social Innovation: Emerging Trends and Challenges for Practice, Policy and Education in Europe","title-short":"Social Work and Social Innovation","editor":[{"family":"Wilken","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Parpan-Blaser","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Prosser","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Pas","given":"Suzan","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Erik"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"wilken2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"wilken2024"},{"id":"akca2024","type":"paper-conference","event-place":"Lisbon, Portugal","event-title":"Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Management Leadership and Governance, ECMLG2024","publisher-place":"Lisbon, Portugal","title":"What is the Role of Social Capital in the Innovation Creation Process?

Yet, local people can be excluded in tourism  development processes and as users of tourism services. Such exclusive development  can reduce community resilience by focusing on the economic needs and innovations of the industry rather than widely addressing local wishes. As an alternative, inclusive development in tourism emphasizes acknowledging local perspectives and making tourism more beneficial for both locals and tourists. Acknowledging diverse community perspectives, leaving no one behind in development, and maximizing positive tourism impacts are central for enabling more sustainable tourism development, alongside the overarching need for environmentally sustainable tourism. However, research on different community perspectives towards inclusive development in tourism  has remained limited. In addition, studies on the means for changing the exclusive development paths are highly needed. This thesis suggests that the diverse perspectives towards tourism development and the means for change can be studied through social  innovations. Social innovations can be transformative, multi-sectoral, cooperative processes and outcomes that create social value. They provide alternative options for business-focused innovations and development processes in tourism.\nSocial innovations and tourism are studied in Kemi, Finland, where tourism has been strongly developed in recent decades. Through an ethnographic approach, local views on tourism are examined via three perspectives: the public sector actors not usually included in tourism development; the actors working directly in tourism; and local young people who are traditionally very little heard in tourism development. It is elaborated what kinds of needs for change the three community groups identify in relation to tourism and what kinds of initiatives have been or are hoped to be carried out for realizing the change. Three actualized social innovations and three social innovation propositions are introduced and their contribution to inclusive development and community resilience-building, in relation to tourism, is examined.\nThe aim of the thesis is to examine tourism through social innovations as part of inclusive development and community resilience-building and to further evaluate the potential of social innovations to enhance sustainability. Thus, it is studied how social innovations contribute to inclusive development and community resilience-building in relation to tourism and, in this context, to sustainability; how different local community members (public sector actors, actors working directly in tourism, and young people) perceive tourism development and tourism in Kemi; and how social innovations contribute to inclusive development and community resilience-building in relation to tourism and, further, to sustainability in Kemi.\nThe findings indicate that locals identify needs for more inclusive development in tourism in terms of services and co-operation in development. Local social innovations (a cooking club and a youth service centre) not directly linked with tourism can provide insights of how tourism could benefit wide needs in communities. Social innovations in tourism (a locally embedded tourism development project renewing an old industrial island into a recreation area) and social innovation propositions in tourism (a platform for enhancing the flow of information regarding tourism; and a movie theatre or a petrol station for finding a space for hanging out) can diversify available services for addressing local needs. Thus, the results show that social innovations can help with shedding light on the entangled nature of tourism and communities and bring understanding of the context of tourism development by noticing the local challenges and needs as well as novel possibilities and ideas for change. In particular, social innovations can challenge the status quo of tourism by bringing out non-traditional perspectives in development and by redirecting the focus of tourism towards local needs, beyond the usual business-centred perspectives. Furthermore, social innovations can bring value that is first and foremost social, yet also potentially economically and environmentally relevant. In addition, they can provide a methodological tool for tourism development. In these ways, social innovations enhance inclusive development in tourism and build community resilience, as well as contribute to enhancing sustainability. Particularly, social innovations can help in narrowing down the wide sustainability goals into practical processes. Yet, it is also important to remember that the value social innovations create can be perspective dependent.\nThus, the thesis argues that 1) social innovations can challenge the state of tourism development by emphasizing socially embedded development over business-focused processes and initiatives, 2) social innovations can enhance inclusive development and  build community resilience by directing tourism towards local needs and by identifying non-traditional perspectives in planning and development, and 3) social innovations can contribute to enhancing sustainability, yet the contribution requires critical evaluation as well because social innovations do not necessarily holistically address the sustainability issues of tourism.\nConclusively, inclusive development and community resilience-building informed by social innovations can, eventually, contribute to enhancing sustainability and its core idea of leaving no one behind in development, as well as to the need to minimize the negative impacts of tourism and maximize the positive. However, their contribution to comprehensive sustainability requires also critical evaluation and further research, especially by acknowledging the interlinked needs for sustaining socio-environmental systems at multiple scales.","container-title":"Nordia Geographical Publications","DOI":"10.30671/nordia.147795","ISSN":"2736-9722, 1238-2086","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"NGP","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","page":"1-69","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social innovations for inclusive development in tourism – insights from Kemi, Finland","URL":"https://nordia.journal.fi/article/view/147795","volume":"53","author":[{"family":"Partanen","given":"Mari"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"citation-key":"partanen2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"partanen2024"},{"id":"stockdale2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Background Collaborative Workspaces are rapidly growing and evolving across the world. Traditionally understood as an urban phenomenon, most research understands them as either ‘entrepreneurial-led’, as profit-driven and commercial spaces such as business incubators and accelerators, or ‘community-led’ as being bottom-up, not-for-profit ventures aimed at catering for the needs of their community. Recent years however have seen their diffusion beyond large urban agglomerations to small towns and villages, with their functions assumed to be more community-orientated. At the same time, social innovation, or social innovation processes have been gaining prominence in academia, policy, and practice, as they address societal problems and hold potential for new forms of social relations. This paper attempts to provide a novel framework towards understanding the transformative potential of rural collaborative workspaces, as they engage in processes of social innovation, by drawing from diverse and community economies literature and assemblage thinking. Methods The paper uses international case study comparison between rural Austria and Greece (One case from each country). Methods applied were: semi-structured interviews (N=28), participant observation and focus groups (2). Results Community-led rural collaborative workspaces hold transformative potential from i) their ability to assist rural actors with their capacities and realizing their desires and ii) changing individual subjectivities towards collective. Through changing social relations in praxis and perceptions, we examine how social innovation processes through collaborative workspaces can be understood as a means of opening new economic subjectivities towards creating community economies as their transformative potential. Conclusions Although rural collaborative workspaces hold potential for societal transformation, they require further institutionalization and support to move beyond the interstitial and symbiotic stages of transformation.","container-title":"Open Research Europe","DOI":"10.12688/openreseurope.18007.1","ISSN":"2732-5121","journalAbbreviation":"Open Res Europe","language":"en","page":"205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transformative social innovation and rural collaborative workspace assemblages as a means of prefiguring community economies","URL":"https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/4-205/v1","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Stockdale","given":"Colm"},{"family":"Avdikos","given":"Vasilis"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,19]]},"citation-key":"stockdale2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"stockdale2024"},{"id":"oliveira2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article explores the relevance of the social economy in addressing contemporary challenges through innovative and sustainable practices, supported by public policies. The research investigates the management models that social and solidarity economy organizations (SSEOs) employ to respond to the challenges of innovation and sustainability. The study includes an in-depth analysis of diverse operational models and accomplishments across various cases, presenting evidence on how the sector adopts innovative and sustainable practices. The article scrutinizes essential characteristics of SSEOs, such as democratic governance, reinvestment of surpluses in social businesses based on innovation and entrepreneurship, and a strong community orientation. These characteristics are examined for their relevance in addressing issues like social inequalities, digital transformation, and climate change. Additionally, the research includes an examination of four diverse cases of SSEOs established in mainland Portugal. It reveals the wide range of activities and significant interactions that these organizations have with various stakeholders in different economic and social contexts, contributing to regional social innovation ecosystems. The empirical study, based on a descriptive case study methodology applied to multiple and heterogeneous cases (in terms of fields of intervention and scale of resources), demonstrates that sustainability has become a driver in the social economy, within a framework of democratic governance and community involvement. Moreover, the research fills a gap in empirical literature by providing strong evidence through real cases of collaborative social innovation, the integration of environmental, social, and governance practices, as well as financial and regulatory support from the state for the resilience of SSEOs. The social value of the research lies in its empirical contribution to demonstrating how social business is a crucial element for communities to address global challenges, promoting economic growth and employment, social justice, including the fight against poverty, and environmental sustainability.","container-title":"European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship","DOI":"10.34190/ecie.19.1.2608","ISSN":"2049-1069, 2049-1050","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"ECIE","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0","page":"581-587","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Social Economy and Contemporary Challenges: Innovation and Sustainability","title-short":"The Social Economy and Contemporary Challenges","URL":"https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/ecie/article/view/2608","volume":"19","author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Pedro"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,20]]},"citation-key":"oliveira2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"oliveira2024"},{"id":"ujj2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study examines key competencies in social organic farming (SOF) as perceived by stakeholders in Hungary, Greece, and Italy, including necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

This, in turn, fosters sustainable agriculture, circular economies, and public health, thereby strengthening community resilience and ecological stability.","container-title":"Journal of Ecohumanism","DOI":"10.62754/joe.v3i8.5174","ISSN":"2752-6801, 2752-6798","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"JoE","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fostering Sustainable Communities: Competencies and Training Needs for Social Organic Farming in Hungary, Greece, and Italy","title-short":"Fostering Sustainable Communities","URL":"https://ecohumanism.co.uk/joe/ecohumanism/article/view/5174","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Ujj","given":"Apolka"},{"family":"Jancsovszka","given":"Paulina"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mohammad Daud"},{"family":"Voloudakis","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Dávid","given":"Lóránt Dénes"},{"family":"Pércsi","given":"Kinga Nagyné"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,9]]},"citation-key":"ujj2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ujj2024"},{"id":"nemeth2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Social innovation grassroots initiatives play a pivotal role in addressing locally occurring problems - such as aging population, high unemployment, and inequality of disadvantaged groups - by recognizing them and responding with adequate answers that are in harmony with the needs of the local community. Therefore, focusing on the even more urgent difficulties of sustainable, bottom-up initiatives of social innovation, the balance of effective governance and locals has an enormous role in fostering real solutions. However, the process to solve these challenges is multifaceted, based on the renewal capacity of the local community that is rooted in the volume of involvement, effort and willingness to adapt and learn, including on the one hand the local inhabitants, and on the other hand the decision-makers, politicians and administrations. By examining the impacts of local developments and effective governance in the context of social innovation the authors seek answers how local developments and effective governance can contribute to enhance social innovation and what are the biggest challenges of local communities they are facing? What kind of instruments can contribute to create a positive change?  With respect to the research question, the methodology contains qualitative focus group discussions, where professionals from business, academia, government, and civil organizations were asked. In conclusion, the results and novelty of the research show that local developments supporting the partnerships between the stakeholders, have a massive goal to jointly support the progress of public goods and life-quality, sustain and increase local wealth, knowledge transfer, strengthen the cohesion among locals, and support prosperity in a determined local territory. By drawing attention into real cases the authors introduce how to support social innovation in diverse areas of life through effective governance and local developments. The research emphasizes the importance of modern forms of local governance to establish an ecosystem that supports the processes of social innovation with appropriate instruments, including the capability, attitude, talent, and commitment of local governance leaders, role of cooperation culture among quadruple helix members and the necessity of knowledge transfer and adaptation between stakeholders.","container-title":"European Conference on Knowledge Management","DOI":"10.34190/eckm.25.1.2420","ISSN":"2048-8971, 2048-8963","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"ECKM","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","page":"460-469","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Examining the Impact of Local Developments and Effective Governance to Foster Social Innovation Practices","URL":"https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/eckm/article/view/2420","volume":"25","author":[{"family":"Németh","given":"Eszter"},{"family":"Máhr","given":"Tivadar"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,3]]},"citation-key":"nemeth2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"nemeth2024"},{"id":"diop2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"BMC Health Services Research","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-024-11926-9","ISSN":"1472-6963","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"BMC Health Serv Res","language":"en","page":"1430","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social innovation in access to healthcare: community-based health insurance among Senegalese migrants in Spain","title-short":"Social innovation in access to healthcare","URL":"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-024-11926-9","volume":"24","author":[{"family":"Diop","given":"Modou"},{"family":"Sobczyk","given":"Rita"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,18]]},"citation-key":"diop2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"diop2024"},{"id":"wlezien2012","type":"article-journal","container-title":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402382.2012.713752","ISSN":"0140-2382, 1743-9655","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"West European Politics","language":"en","page":"1407-1432","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Political Institutions and the Opinion–Policy Link","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402382.2012.713752","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Wlezien","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Soroka","given":"Stuart N."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11]]},"citation-key":"wlezien2012","library":"My Library","citekey":"wlezien2012"},{"id":"rasmussen2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            A strong link between citizen preferences and public policy is one of the key goals and criteria of democratic governance.

Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.04451","note":"arXiv:2310.04451 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2310.04451","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"AutoDAN: Generating Stealthy Jailbreak Prompts on Aligned Large Language Models","title-short":"AutoDAN","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04451","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaogeng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Muhao"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Chaowei"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"citation-key":"liu2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"liu2024"},{"id":"zou2023","type":"article","abstract":"Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors. Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past automatic prompt generation methods. Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs. Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e., queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B).

This approach is based on the concept of sustainable fisheries management and focuses on increasing the importance of the involvement of local communities in conservation and management. Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs), created to harmonise social development in a broad sense with the specific, sectoral development of fishing, have become key players in this process in some European countries. In Galicia (NW Spain), FLAGs started to be created in 2008, and soon they were deeply integrated into the small‐scale fisheries (SSF) sector, which was already highly organised. Thus, synergies have been established between\n              cofradías—\n              fisheries organisations with a key role and strong responsibilities in the management of fisheries resources‐ and FLAGs. This article studies the interdependencies between\n              cofradías\n              and FLAGs and how these relationships can influence the development of SSF and their communities. Galician FLAGs and\n              cofradías\n              have created in general positive relationships that contributed to the development of the SSF sector. On the other hand, bureaucratic obligations are concentrated funding in larger\n              cofradías\n              , while the needs of the most vulnerable fishing stakeholders are less covered.","container-title":"Sociologia Ruralis","DOI":"10.1111/soru.12490","ISSN":"0038-0199, 1467-9523","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Sociologia Ruralis","language":"en","page":"415-444","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The <i>cofradías</i> ’ role within the Fisheries Local Action Groups system: Implications for small‐scale fisheries in Galicia (Spain)","title-short":"The <i>cofradías</i> ’ role within the Fisheries Local Action Groups system","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soru.12490","volume":"64","author":[{"family":"García‐Lorenzo","given":"Iria"},{"family":"Piñeiro‐Antelo","given":"María Ángeles"},{"family":"Villasante","given":"Sebastián"},{"family":"Pita","given":"Pablo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"citation-key":"garcia-lorenzo2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"garcia-lorenzo2024"},{"id":"miles2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Social Entrepreneurship","DOI":"10.1080/19420676.2024.2326851","ISSN":"1942-0676, 1942-0684","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Social Entrepreneurship","language":"en","page":"1-23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social Entrepreneurship, Empowerment of Women Experiencing Homelessness and Gender Equality","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19420676.2024.2326851","author":[{"family":"Miles","given":"Lilian"},{"family":"Granados","given":"Maria L."},{"family":"Tweed","given":"Joy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"citation-key":"miles2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"miles2024"},{"id":"olmedo2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Geography is a significant element of social innovation.

To do so, we use data from 336 surveys from urban (213) and rural (123) WISEs and conduct an exploratory and spatially sensitive analysis to compare the characteristics, in terms of organisational age, legal and governance form, multiplicity of activities, revenue diversification; and contributions towards impact, in terms of geographical focus/reach, employment, volunteers, and income generation. Our analysis shows that WISEs in urban and rural areas present rather similar organisational characteristics and ways of functioning (legal structure, multiactivity, multiple sources of funding), but their contributions to socioeconomic impact differ according to their spatial location, with urban WISEs generating significantly more employment and income than their rural counterparts. Our study illustrates that socially innovative organisations are spatially sensitive, and that context influences their capacity to create sustainable employment opportunities and contribute to the local economy.","container-title":"Societies","DOI":"10.3390/soc14060082","ISSN":"2075-4698","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Societies","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"82","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rural–Urban Features of Social Innovation: An Exploratory Study of Work Integration Social Enterprises in Ireland","title-short":"Rural–Urban Features of Social Innovation","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/14/6/82","volume":"14","author":[{"family":"Olmedo","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Ruiz-Rivera","given":"María José"},{"family":"O’Shaughnessy","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Chatzichristos","given":"Georgios"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"citation-key":"olmedo2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"olmedo2024"},{"id":"pospech2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            We have studied how people make sense of their lives in peripheral rural regions.

Intensive agriculture is deeply implicated in high greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity decline and water pollution. As a more socio-economically heterogenous rural Europe emerges with a greater non-farming component, changes such as in-migration and tourism in some areas can also be seen to compromise sustainability, as can an ageing and declining population in others. The dominant means of European rural policy support has been direct income payments to farmers, with modest but increasing expectations of environmental cross-compliance over time. Since the early 1990s, new policy means have been introduced, many based around collaborative actions to enhance sustainability. These include the European Union (EU) Leader scheme, environmental cooperatives, catchment management projects and support for community renewable energy. These changes mark a shift from sectoral support to a more territorial and place-based policy, often built around collaborative partnership models. Scotland has developed a wide and distinctive range of communitarian policies to support sustainable rural development which connect to this territorial approach. This paper reviews the contribution of communitarian and collaborative policies to sustainability transitions, drawing primarily on Scottish policy but referencing these policies against policies in other developed economies.","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su16020870","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Sustainability","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"870","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Collaborative Action, Policy Support and Rural Sustainability Transitions in Advanced Western Economies: The Case of Scotland","title-short":"Collaborative Action, Policy Support and Rural Sustainability Transitions in Advanced Western Economies","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/2/870","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Slee","given":"Bill"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"citation-key":"slee2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"slee2024"},{"id":"howaldt2017b","type":"book","event-place":"Dortmund","publisher":"TU Dortmund","publisher-place":"Dortmund","title":"Towards a general theory and typology of social innovation.

Our analysis focuses on three social processes that emerged from this fieldlab: (a) deepening of community relations around and through agri‐food; (b) learning in agri‐food initiatives and (c) politicisation of agri‐food systems. We analyse the manifestations of and limitations of these three processes concerning the CBG's attempt to become a local food community.

The overall findings suggest that employees’ individually perceived participation in organisational decision making (IPD) had a stronger relation to job satisfaction (ρ = .25), job involvement/work motivation (ρ = .36), prosocial work behaviours (ρ = .24), civic and democratic behaviours (ρ = .21) and perceived supportive climate (ρ = .44) than the other two OD indicators: structurally anchored employee participation (SAEP) and employee participation in collective ownership (EO). This was not the case for value‐based commitment: the relations of SAEP (ρ = .40), EO (ρ = .34), and IPD (ρ = .46) with commitment were nearly equal. Mediation analyses indicated that IPD partially mediated most of the effects of SAEP and EO on the outcomes mentioned.

However, the longstanding viability as well as economic success of democratic enterprises in a capitalistic market environment has long been contested. For instance, this has given rise to widespread endorsement of the “degeneration thesis” and the so-called “iron law of oligarchy”. By reviewing 77 qualitative studies that examined 83 democratic enterprises (including 15 studies on nine enterprises of the Mondragon Cooperative Cooperation network) within the last 50 years, the present systematic review provides evidence that such enterprises are able to economically survive and prosper. The majority of studied enterprises (63.5%) either resisted pressures toward degeneration or subsequently regenerated after undergoing degenerative processes. Only 9.5% fully degenerated in accordance with the degeneration thesis and the “iron law of oligarchy”, while 27.0% of the democratic enterprises showed diverse and mixed forms of degeneration tendencies, indicating that the notion of an “iron law” needs to be revised. Within the nine investigated cases of Mondragon not one single enterprise or group fully degenerated. Three cases showed degenerative tendencies, another three one degeneration tendencies and simultaneously regeneration, one case fully resisted degeneration tendencies (retention) and two cases regenerated. Further, this systematic review provides an overview of organizational and external conditions, non-/democratic or non-/participative practices and psychological phenomena that contribute to the degeneration, regeneration, or resistance to degeneration (i.e., retention). The described examples of such practices may help practitioners to implement and maintain democratic structures and processes in contemporary organizations.","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.947559","ISSN":"1664-1078","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

The articles comprising this issue include an explicit recognition and discussion of intertwined and socially constructed identities, labels, power, and privilege as explicated by pioneering Black feminists who introduced the concept of intersectionality. Taken together, the articles within this issue identify and articulate the powerful ideological forces and subsequent policies and practices working against transformational action. As such, we are not calling for the inclusion of disabled people into society as it is today—wrought with social, economic, and environmental crises. Rather, we seek a transformation of the status quo whereby disabled people are respected as an inherent part of human diversity with gifts and worthiness untangled from a capitalist and colonial system of exploitation, extraction, and oppression. This means that achieving social justice and inclusion requires radically reordering our economic and political systems. This thematic issue illuminates the impacts and root causes of exclusion to foment critical thinking about the possibilities for social inclusion from the perspective of those who are marginalized by the status quo.","container-title":"Social Inclusion","DOI":"10.17645/si.v11i4.7798","ISSN":"2183-2803","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"SI","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"287-290","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Disabled People and the Intersectional Nature of Social Inclusion","URL":"https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/7798","volume":"11","author":[{"family":"Buettgen","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Fontes","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Susan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"citation-key":"buettgen2023","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"buettgen2023"},{"id":"cumbers2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"We seek to advance debate and thinking about economic democracy.

We outline a framework where both individual rights to self-government of one’s own labour, as well as the right of all citizens to participate in economic decision-making, are emphasised. The framework identifies a set of underlying principles, prerequisites, critical spheres for intervention, progressive institutional arrangements, and policies in pursuit of an expanded agenda around economic democracy.

The dominant consensus‐building perspective problematizes the politicization of climate change as an important barrier to climate action and resultantly sets out to develop depoliticizing communication strategies which foster social consensus and public engagement. In contrast to this, the critical debate perspective problematizes climate change's capture in a depoliticized consensus and calls for its repoliticization to revive democratic debate and citizenship. The aim of this article is twofold. First, we will distinguish both perspectives on the basis of their diverging problem diagnoses and recommendations. Second, we will argue how only the critical debate perspective provides the tools for transformative socioecological change based on both democratic debate and democratic citizenship.

Published posthumously in 1839, Lenz is a taut case study of three weeks in the life of a schizophrenic, perhaps the first third-person text ever to be written from the \"inside\" of insanity. Partially based on the memoir of an Alsatian pastor describing Lenz's stay with him in 1778 (translated here in its entirety for the first time), Büchner's text moves well beyond its source by the rapt and virtually autistic attention it brings to the details of the natural world, whose landscapes prefigure those of Cézanne or Van Gogh.

We review 52 articles in organization studies and develop a typology of how researchers construct their research questions from existing literature. The most common way across paradigmatic camps is to spot various ‘gaps’ in the literature and, based on that, to formulate specific research questions. The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature. The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories.","container-title":"Organization","DOI":"10.1177/1350508410372151","ISSN":"1350-5084, 1461-7323","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Organization","language":"en","page":"23-44","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ways of constructing research questions: gap-spotting or problematization?","title-short":"Ways of constructing research questions","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508410372151","volume":"18","author":[{"family":"Sandberg","given":"Jörgen"},{"family":"Alvesson","given":"Mats"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1]]},"citation-key":"sandberg2011","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"sandberg2011"},{"id":"rix2022","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The involvement of all participants within all aspects of the research process is a well-established challenge for participatory research.

As smart cities continue to develop, it is important to explore how open data will affect the stakeholders of smart public spaces. Making data open and accessible not only has a managerial and technical component but also creates opportunities to shift power dynamics by granting individuals (and entities) access to data they might not otherwise be able to obtain. The scope of those who could access these data is wide, including data-illiterate citizens, burgeoning startups, and foreign militaries. This paper details the process of making data “open” from the MX3D smart bridge in Amsterdam through a “datathon”. The development and outcomes of opening the data and the event itself bring us closer to understanding the complexity of open data access and the extent to which it is useful or empowering for members of the public. While open data research continues to expand, there is still a dearth of studies that qualitatively detail the process and stakeholder concerns for a modern smart city project. This article serves to fill this gap.","container-title":"Smart Cities","DOI":"10.3390/smartcities6020032","ISSN":"2624-6511","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Smart Cities","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","note":"angeschaut","page":"676-691","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Open Data Insights from a Smart Bridge Datathon: A Multi-Stakeholder Observation of Smart City Open Data in Practice","title-short":"Open Data Insights from a Smart Bridge Datathon","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-6511/6/2/32","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Cammers-Goodwin","given":"Sage"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,21]]},"citation-key":"cammers-goodwin2023","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"cammers-goodwin2023"},{"id":"oreilly-debrun2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              \n                The material practices which researchers use in research partnerships may enable or constrain the nature of engagement with stakeholder groups.

A debate within this field is whether participation's primary function is to support participants taking ownership over social change in their communities (an empowerment approach) or to garner feedback, particularly during the evaluation stage, in order for implementers to more efficiently assess project goals and adjust project design (a so-called ‘practical’ approach). This paper makes the claim that a greater focus on theory building through participatory data analysis can help bridge the divide between the empowerment and practicality camps. It does so by simultaneously embracing the assumptions behind empowerment ideologies (that community members hold the key to understanding and changing policies and systems) and behind more ‘practical’ approaches (that participation is immensely useful and practical for creating and improving interventions). I discuss a participatory evaluation of a US intimate partner violence intervention in order to demonstrate how participation supports theory building, including the crucial findings that emerged which the researcher, as an outsider, had missed.

In each project, marginalized women were trained as Inclusion Researchers (IRs) and participated in all stages of the research process. Given the emphasis of the projects on inclusion, it was important that a data analysis process be developed that was group oriented, engaging, understandable, and inclusive of the community researchers.\n\tMethods: A five-part analysis process is described including preparation of the data, grouping and coding, consolidation, making sense of the data, and producing a report. This group analysis process took place over 2 full days with facilitation by an academic researcher, Details about the techniques used for each step are described.\n\tConclusions: The strengths of this participatory qualitative data analysis process were that it enabled participation of people with a mixture of levels of education and familiarity with analysis; it enabled community member control of the interpretation; and it could handle large volumes of data quickly. The main limitation was that additional time and procedures would be necessary for a deeper analysis or for groups of over 25 participants. The factors that contributed to the success of this participatory analysis process included accessible and clear procedures, use of visual grouping techniques, and a positive and supportive atmosphere for participation.","container-title":"Progress in Community Health Partnerships: Research, Education, and

To understand these switches, we focus on the saturation of the party system. We theorize that when a party system is oversaturated – i.e. when a higher effective number of parties contests elections than predicted based on socio‐political contextual characteristics (the system's ‘carrying capacity’) – it becomes increasingly likely that: (1) mainstream party voters defect to niche parties; and (2) niche party voters refrain from switching to mainstream parties. Based on vote‐switching patterns in 15 countries and 53 elections, we find that oversaturation increases shifts from mainstream to niche parties. Further analyses show that this holds for shifts from mainstream to radical left and right parties, but not for shifts to green parties. This has important consequences for research on vote switching, the electoral consequences of policy differentiation and the competition between niche and mainstream parties.\n          , \n            Zusammenfassung\n            Wann wechseln Wähler von Mainstream‐ zu Nischenparteien und umgekehrt? Um dies zu verstehen, schauen wir auf die Sättigung des Parteiensystems. Wenn ein Parteiensystem übersättigt ist – d. h. wenn eine größere effektive Anzahl von Parteien an Wahlen teilnimmt als aufgrund gesellschaftspolitischer Kontextmerkmale (‘Tragfähigkeit’ des Systems) vorhergesagt – wird es immer wahrscheinlicher, dass (1) Wähler von Mainstream‐Parteien zu Nischenparteien wechseln, und (2) Wähler von Nischenparteien nicht Mainstream‐Parteien wechseln. Basierend auf einer Analyse von Stimmwechseln anlässlich von 53 Wahlen in 15 Ländern stellen wir fest, dass die Übersättigung des Parteiensystem Stimmwechsel von Mainstream‐ zu Nischenparteien begünstigt. Zusätzlich zeigen wir, dass dies für Wechsel von Mainstreamparteien hin zu links‐ und rechtsradikalen Parteien gilt, nicht jedoch für Wechsel hin zu grünen Parteien. Dieses Ergebnis ist wichtig für die Forschung zu Stimmwechseln, den Wahlfolgen politischer Differenzierung und dem Wettbewerb zwischen Nischen‐ und Mainstream‐Parteien.\n          , \n            Résumé\n            Quand les électeurs passent‐ils des partis traditionnels aux partis de niche et vice versa? Pour répondre à cette question, nous nous concentrons sur la saturation du système partisan. Nous théorisons que lorsqu'un système de partis est sursaturé – c'est‐à‐dire lorsqu'un nombre effectif de partis en lice pour les élections est plus élevé que prévu sur la base des caractéristiques contextuelles sociopolitiques (la ‘capacité de charge’ du système) – il devient plus probable que (1) les électeurs des partis traditionnels se tournent vers des partis de niche, et (2) les électeurs des partis de niche s'abstiennent de se tourner vers les partis traditionnels. En nous basant sur les modèles de changement de vote dans 15 pays et 53 élections, nous constatons que la sursaturation augmente le passage des partis traditionnels aux partis de niche. Des analyses plus approfondies montrent que cela vaut pour le passage des partis traditionnels aux partis radicaux de gauche et de droite, mais pas pour le passage aux partis verts. Cela a des conséquences importantes pour la recherche sur le changement de vote, les conséquences électorales de la différenciation politique et la concurrence entre les partis de niche et les partis traditionnels.\n          , \n            Riassunto\n            Quando gli elettori passano dai partiti tradizionali a quelli di nicchia e viceversa? Per capire questo fenomeno l’articolo si focalizza sulla saturazione del sistema partitico. La nostra tesi è che quando un sistema partitico è sovrasaturo – cioè quando il numero effettivo di partiti che partecipano alle elezioni è più elevato di quanto previsto sulla base delle caratteristiche socio‐politiche contestuali (la cosiddetta ‘carying capacity’ del sistema) – diventa sempre più probabile che (1) gli elettori dei partiti tradizionali passino ai partiti di nicchia, mentre (2) gli elettori dei partiti di nicchia tendano a non passare ai partiti tradizionali. Sulla base dei modelli di ‘vote‐switching’ analizzati in 15 paesi e 53 elezioni, scopriamo che la sovrasaturazione aumenta lo spostamento dell’elettorato dai partiti tradizionali a quelli di nicchia. Ulteriori analisi mostrano che ciò vale per il passaggio dai partiti tradizionali ai partiti radicali di sinistra e di destra, ma non verso i partiti ecologisti. Tale risultato ha conseguenze importanti per la ricerca sul ‘vote‐switching’, sulle conseguenze elettorali della differenziazione delle politiche pubbliche e sulla competizione tra partiti di nicchia e quelli tradizionali.","container-title":"Swiss Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1111/spsr.12579","ISSN":"1424-7755, 1662-6370","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Swiss Political Sci Review","language":"en","page":"422-442","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Past the saturation point: Why voters switch from mainstream to niche parties and vice‐versa","title-short":"Past the saturation point","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12579","volume":"29","author":[{"family":"Van De Wardt","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Rooduijn","given":"Matthijs"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"citation-key":"vandewardt2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"vandewardt2023"},{"id":"white2025","type":"article-newspaper","abstract":"The centre left’s failure has left a vacuum that’s been filled by those offering hope, rather than a technocratic status quo, says the LSE’s Jonathan White","container-title":"The Guardian","ISSN":"0261-3077","language":"en-GB","section":"Opinion","source":"The Guardian","title":"How Trump and the new right came to ‘own’ the future – while apparently exploiting the past","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/18/donald-trump-new-right-centre-left-technocratic","author":[{"family":"White","given":"Jonathan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"citation-key":"white2025","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"white2025"},{"id":"miller-idriss","type":"webpage","abstract":"The far right is best understood as a spectrum of groups and individuals who are often at odds with one another but hold in common some combination…","language":"en","title":"White Supremacists and the Far Right in the US","URL":"https://www.gale.com/intl/essays/cynthia-miller-idriss-white-supremacist-extremism-far-right-us","author":[{"family":"Miller-Idriss","given":"Cynthia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,27]]},"citation-key":"miller-idriss","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"miller-idriss"},{"id":"lehmann2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Immigration is one of the most widely debated issues today. It has, therefore, also become an important issue in party competition, and radical right parties are trying to exploit the issue. This opens up many pressing questions for researchers. To answer these questions, data on the self‐ascribed and unified party positions on immigration and immigrant integration issues is needed. So far, researchers have relied on expert survey data, media analysis data and ‘proxy’ categories from the Manifesto Project Dataset. However, the former two only give the mediated party position, and the latter relies on proxies that do not specifically measure immigration. The new dataset presented in this article provides researchers with party positions and saliency estimates on two issue dimensions – immigration and immigrant integration – in 14 countries and 43 elections. Deriving the data from manifestos enables the provision of parties’ unified and unfiltered immigration positions for countries and time points not covered in expert surveys and media studies, making it possible to link immigration and immigrant integration positions and saliency scores to other issue areas covered in the Manifesto Project Dataset. Well‐established criteria are used to distinguish between statements on (1) immigration control and (2) immigrant integration. This allows for a more fine‐grained analysis along these two dimensions. Furthermore, the dataset has been generated using the new method of crowd coding, which allows a relatively fast manual coding of political texts.

It broadened the scope of representative democracy to encompass representation activities beyond those authorized by elections, transformed our thinking and provided a new perspective, putting claims and their reception into the center. This paradigm shift erased the distinction between elected and non-elected representatives and disclosed the potential of non-elected actors’ claims to represent (Andeweg, 2003; Kuyper, 2016; Rosanvallon &amp; Goldhammer, 2008; Saward, 2006, 2009; Van Biezen &amp; Saward, 2008). In spite of this lively debate, we identify an important gap in the literature: while this paradigmatic shift inspired many authors, conceptual <em>frameworks that can be applied for systematic empirical analysis of real-life cases</em> are missing. In this article, we fill this gap and propose frameworks for assessing and validating a variety of real-life claims. Our study provides empirical substance to the ongoing theoretical debates, helping to translate the mainly theoretical ‘claim approach’ into empirical research tools. It helps to transform the conventional wisdom about what representation can (not) be and shines a new light on the potential future of (claims on) representation.","container-title":"Politics and Governance","DOI":"10.17645/pag.v7i3.2103","ISSN":"2183-2463","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"PaG","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"98-111","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Saward’s Concept of the Representative Claim Revisited: An Empirical Perspective","title-short":"Saward’s Concept of the Representative Claim Revisited","URL":"https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/2103","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Guasti","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Geissel","given":"Brigitte"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,1]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,24]]},"citation-key":"guasti2019a","library":"My Library","citekey":"guasti2019a"},{"id":"kim2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Political Ideologies","DOI":"10.1080/13569317.2024.2413593","ISSN":"1356-9317, 1469-9613","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Political Ideologies","language":"en","page":"1-20","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Performativity and political organization after the squares: rethinking horizontality and verticality","title-short":"Performativity and political organization after the squares","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569317.2024.2413593","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Seongcheol"},{"family":"Karavasilis","given":"Lazaros"},{"family":"Nonhoff","given":"Martin"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,13]]},"citation-key":"kim2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"kim2024"},{"id":"nonnemacher2023","type":"article-journal","container-title":"West European Politics","DOI":"10.1080/01402382.2022.2040237","ISSN":"0140-2382, 1743-9655","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"West European Politics","language":"en","page":"24-48","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Representational deprivation: niche parties, niche voters and political protest","title-short":"Representational deprivation","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2022.2040237","volume":"46","author":[{"family":"Nonnemacher","given":"Jeffrey"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,2]]},"citation-key":"nonnemacher2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"nonnemacher2023"},{"id":"stiers2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Niche parties have gained substantial political ground in many liberal democracies.

In this study, I investigate why voters support niche parties. Building on previous research, I hypothesise that niche voting can be driven both by ideological considerations and by voter discontent. Analyses on 61 elections in 28 countries show that voters support niche parties mostly because of policy considerations – such as their ideological position and core issues – and less because of dissatisfaction with mainstream parties. These results show that a niche vote is in the first place a policy-driven vote and not a sign of protest with mainstream politics, and this finding holds important implications for our understanding of electoral results.","container-title":"Party Politics","DOI":"10.1177/13540688241273930","ISSN":"1354-0688, 1460-3683","journalAbbreviation":"Party Politics","language":"en","page":"13540688241273930","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why do voters support niche parties?","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13540688241273930","author":[{"family":"Stiers","given":"Dieter"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,16]]},"citation-key":"stiers2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"stiers2024"},{"id":"plotke1997","type":"article-journal","abstract":"During the Cold War, arguments about representation were a significant part of international debates about democracy.

Improvement actions focused on transformation towards a CE should be targeted at all groups of materials and waste. As water is essential for human survival and well-being and plays a significant role in sustainable development (SD), the actions related to the reuse of water and the recovery of raw materials from wastewater and other water-based waste should be taken. The paper presents a proposition for a new CE model framework in the water and wastewater sector, which includes the six following actions: reduction—prevent wastewater generation in the first place by the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source; reclamation (removal)—an application of effective technologies for the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater; reuse—reuse of wastewater as an alternative source of water supply (non-potable usage), recycling—recovery of water from wastewater for potable usage; recovery—recovery of resources such as nutrients and energy from water-based waste, and rethink—rethinking how to use resources to create a sustainable economy, which is `free` of waste and emissions. The novelty of the proposed CE model framework is that it presents possible ways of implementing CE principles in the water and wastewater sector, with a strong emphasis not only technological but also organisational and societal changes. Application of the proposed model may help to further transform the European economy to the CE model. Moreover, the indicated model can be significant tool supporting an assessment of local or regional progress towards CE in the water and wastewater sector and further environmental management and planning.","container-title":"Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management","DOI":"10.1007/s10163-019-00960-z","ISSN":"1611-8227","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management","page":"682-697","title":"Circular economy model framework in the European water and wastewater sector","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10163-019-00960-z","volume":"22","author":[{"family":"Smol","given":"Marzena"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Preisner","given":"Michał"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,1]]},"citation-key":"smol2020","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"smol2020"},{"id":"peydayesh2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Chemical Society reviews","DOI":"10.1039/d3cs00812f","journalAbbreviation":"Chemical Society reviews","title":"The circular economy of water across the six continents","volume":"53","author":[{"family":"Peydayesh","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Mezzenga","given":"Raffaele"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,10]]},"citation-key":"peydayesh2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"peydayesh2024"},{"id":"lee2020a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Water recycling has been offered as an important adaptation for urban water systems facing deficits due to climate change.

In this work, we reviewed a broad range of literature to identify societal values relevant to the recovery of water and other resources from wastewaters, particularly urban and industrial wastewater and desalination brines. We discuss tensions and uncertainties around these values, such as the tension between socio-economic expectations of resource recovery and potential long-term sustainability impacts, as well as uncertainties regarding safety and regulations. For addressing these tensions and uncertainties, we suggest aligning common methods in engineering and the natural sciences with Responsible Innovation approaches, such as Value Sensitive Design and Safe-by-Design.

Rather than weighing in on the potential impact of GenAI, this paper engages with the implicit sociotechnical imaginaries underpinning reactions to GenAI. One particularly evocative source for sociotechnical imaginaries are fictional texts, which can shape our shared imagination of possible and probable futures. Accordingly, I analyze two seminal works of fiction: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (Planet eBooks, 1818) and Franz Kafka’s The Trial (Echo Library, 1925). Frankenstein is regarded as an enduring myth that has shaped perceptions of artificial life. This paper sets out to explore the limitations of the ‘Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary’ by unpacking AI’s assumed modes of meaning-making along three axes: (1) agency, (2) relations, and (3) control. Within the Frankensteinian sociotechnical imaginary, AI is approached in anthropomorphic terms, emphasizing the struggle over control of meaning-making without reshaping its overarching logic. The Trial, in contrast, offers a lens that challenges common dichotomies underpinning the Frankenstein model: (1) highlighting the entanglement between AI and human intentionality in processes of meaning-making, (2) exploring human-AI relations as recursively shaped through the complementary tendency of humans and GenAI to generate and infer meaning, and (3) shifting the notion of control from a struggle over domination to an emphasis on how GenAI concurrently expands the available choices while limiting humans’ influence over patterns of meaning-making.","container-title":"Postdigital Science and Education","DOI":"10.1007/s42438-024-00482-4","ISSN":"2524-485X, 2524-4868","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Postdigit Sci Educ","language":"en","page":"962-977","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Monsters to Mazes: Sociotechnical Imaginaries of AI Between Frankenstein and Kafka","title-short":"From Monsters to Mazes","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42438-024-00482-4","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Dishon","given":"Gideon"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9]]},"citation-key":"dishon2024a","library":"Nomadic_AI","citekey":"dishon2024a"},{"id":"lara2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) be more effective than human instruction for the moral enhancement of people? The author argues that it only would be if the use of this technology were aimed at increasing the individual's capacity to reflectively decide for themselves, rather than at directly influencing behaviour. To support this, it is shown how a disregard for personal autonomy, in particular, invalidates the main proposals for applying new technologies, both biomedical and AI-based, to moral enhancement. As an alternative to these proposals, this article proposes a virtual assistant that, through dialogue, neutrality and virtual reality technologies, can teach users to make better moral decisions on their own. The author concludes that, as long as certain precautions are taken in its design, such an assistant could do this better than a human instructor adopting the same educational

How can we support school students in transforming the base of knowledge and experiences to face the ongoing crises and contribute as individuals, citizens, and active participants in a democratic society to enable the transformation that is called for? We address this broader question through a study framed within the Horizon 2020 project titled Science Education for Action and Engagement toward Sustainability (SEAS), aimed at promoting new forms of scientific literacy and skills to empower students to become agents of change. Most centrally, SEAS aims at incorporating a transformative dimension that is often lacking in current conceptions of scientific literacy. In SEAS, school and school science are conceived as involving learning and transformation across three spheres—the practical, the political, and the personal—where both individuals and their institutional contexts are subject to change as participants gain agency over their learning processes. In this study, we illustrate this approach and present the analysis of a first pilot iteration within the project’s Italian Local Network, which shows the kind of individual/collective dynamic that the project’s transformative activities afford.","container-title":"Frontiers in Education","DOI":"10.3389/feduc.2022.689329","ISSN":"2504-284X","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

Design thinking is conceptually appropriate to support innovative, complex and uncertain business environments. Still, its practices have demonstrated some difficulties in managing the ESoIP, such as lack of structure and clarity around goals. This paper argues that gamification can enhance and complement design thinking in the management of firms' ESoIP.\n            \n            \n              Design/methodology/approach\n              Given the need to achieve a deeper understanding of the linkages between gamification and design thinking, the paper follows an exploratory theory building approach for this complex reality of innovation. The case study research method was conducted in three firms (Trivalor, Novartis and Microsoft) that applied a gamification approach to the ESoIP.\n            \n            \n              Findings\n              The results demonstrate that gamification has the power to enhance and complement design thinking practices by getting tasks more organized and improving coordination and employees' engagement in the innovation process.\n            \n            \n              Practical implications\n              The paper provides critical managerial contributions on how firms can use gamification to improve design thinking approaches to ESoIP. Its consequences are also crucial to innovation, R&D, and product/service development managers interested in using gamification to support the ideation and concept development of new solutions complementing traditional design thinking approaches.\n            \n            \n              Originality/value\n              Merging the gamification and design thinking approaches is novel, particularly on firms' ESoIP.

Since climate action is both urgent and currently insufficient, widespread citizen implication to enact and demand effective change is needed. Of the multiple methods proposed to support climate change engagement, gamification and games are some of the most intriguing. Although some scholarly study has been done to understand their effects and possible role in tackling this issue, multiple gaps still exist between the tentative optimism in the public discourse and a realistic understanding of their true potential.This dissertation aims to analyze the state of the art of gamified climate change engagement, including the scientific literature and existing games, and to assess the cognitive, affective, and behavioral engagement effects of a new climate change game, Climate Connected: Outbreak, which I designed following best practices. For this, the work is situated at the interdisciplinary intersection between (a) gamification, understood as an umbrella term including also serious games and game-based learning, with its focus on the study of game systems and human motivation, and (b) climate change engagement, which denotes a state of cognitive, affective, and behavioral connection with climate change and typically applies concepts from fields such as psychology, communication science, and pedagogy. The work takes from, and contributes to, all these perspectives, and adds to our understanding of the role of gamification in tackling similarly wicked problems and grand challenges. The findings are derived from five studies. First, a systematic review of empirical scientific literature (N=64) was conducted, followed by a review of existing digital game artifacts (N=80). Then, based on identified gaps and best practices, the game Climate Connected: Outbreak was designed, developed, and implemented as a research artifact. The game’s effects were examined both qualitatively (N=12) and quantitatively (N=105), in the latter case in a controlled experiment in which participants were assigned to three groups—text-based control, PC game, and immersive virtual reality (VR) game. The chosen methods approach the phenomenon of gamified climate change engagement from multiple perspectives and focus on diverse objects of study—from literature to games and players.The findings of this dissertation advance our understanding of the potential of gamified interventions for climate change engagement. Publication I systematically reviews the extant empirical corpus of gamified climate change engagement, with a focus on contexts and populations, designs, outcomes, and research quality. It offers a design agenda that highlights, among other issues, the need for more meticulously designed and reported research; the existence of potentially useful but neglected communication frames; the promising effects of supporting behavior by design; and the fact that audiences are often framed in rigid and conventional ways (e.g., as consumers or professionals), neglecting other possible citizen roles. Publication II analyzes digital games that include climate action and examines the avatar identities and actions in them. The study uncovers six types of avatar identity in these games, including a scarcity of citizen and empowered individual roles, and shows how citizen action in games is typically limited to lifestyle choices and public participation.With the insights gathered from the previous publications, Publication III describes the use of Climate Connected: Outbreak, a single-player, story-based digital game for climate change engagement. The game considers gaps and recommendations such as the use of a health and wellbeing framing, a complex and open understanding of the citizen’s identity towards climate change, and the use of immersive VR as an underexplored medium. The results of user research suggest four themes for the participants’ serious game experience—continuity, discontinuity, divergence, and topic engagement. Publications IV and V examine and compare the game’s and control’s effects on learning, climate change attitudes, environmental self-efficacy, and pro-environmental intentions and behavior. The results suggest that games like the one used can be as effective as traditional media in engaging people with climate change while providing a more enjoyable experience, especially in the case of immersive VR. In toto, this dissertation offers a holistic foray into the multidisciplinary area of gamified climate change engagement, offering rigorous studies of literature, games, and player experiences and outcomes as steppingstones to the future development of this area.","collection-title":"Tampere University Dissertations - Tampereen yliopiston väitöskirjat","ISBN":"978-952-03-3254-9","language":"English","publisher":"Tampere University","title":"Gamification and Climate Change Engagement: Building knowledge, developing practice, and studying experiences and effects","author":[{"family":"Fernandez Galeote","given":"Daniel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"fernandezgaleote2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"fernandezgaleote2024"},{"id":"xiong2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Few organizations have combined workshops with gamification to help to save costs, improve the enthusiasm and output efficiency of participants and reduce various deficiencies.

Many studies show improvements with respect to traditional methodologies. Several educational strategies have also been combined with Gamification with interesting results. Interest is growing and evidence suggest Gamification has a promising future. However, there is a barrier preventing many researchers from properly understanding Gamification principles. Gamification focuses of engaging trainees in learning with same intensity that games engage players on playing. But only some very well designed games achieve this level of engagement. Designing truly entertaining games is a difficult task with a great artistic component. Although some studies have tried to clarify how Game Design produces fun, there is no scientific consensus. Well established knowledge on Game Design resides in sets of rules of thumb and good practices, based on empirical experience. Game industry professionals acquire this experience through practice. Most educators and researchers often overlook the need for such experience to successfully design Gamification. And so, many research papers focus on single game-elements like points, present non-gaming activities like questionnaires, design non-engaging activities or fail to comprehend the underlying principles on why their designs do not yield expected results. This work presents a rubric for educators and researchers to start working in Gamification without previous experience in Game Design. This rubric decomposes the continuous space of Game Design into a set of ten discrete characteristics. It is aimed at diminishing the entry barrier and helping to acquire initial experience with Game Design fundamentals. The main proposed uses are twofold: to analyse existing games or gamified activities gaining a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and to help in the design or improvement of activities. Focus is on Game Design characteristics rather than game elements, similarly to professional game designers. The goal is to help gaining experience towards designing successful Gamification environments. Presented rubric is based on our previous design experience, compared and contrasted with literature, and empirically tested with some example games and gamified activities.","container-title":"Informatics","DOI":"10.3390/informatics6040049","ISSN":"2227-9709","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Informatics","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","note":"angeschaut","page":"49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Guide for Game-Design-Based Gamification","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9709/6/4/49","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Gallego-Durán","given":"Francisco J."},{"family":"Villagrá-Arnedo","given":"Carlos J."},{"family":"Satorre-Cuerda","given":"Rosana"},{"family":"Compañ-Rosique","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Molina-Carmona","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Llorens-Largo","given":"Faraón"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,5]]},"citation-key":"gallego-duran2019","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"gallego-duran2019"},{"id":"bakhanova2023","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Problem structuring methods imply the involvement of stakeholders and aim to create a shared understanding of the problem and commitment among them. The process and outcomes of such interventions entirely depend on the stakeholder’s level of engagement and willingness to contribute to the discussion. Gamification, in its turn, has been extensively used to increase engagement in an activity and nudge certain behaviors. Several gamification frameworks exist for stakeholder engagement; however, none fully considers the context of the modeling workshops with stakeholders.\n            In this paper, we focus on a specific method for problem structuring, called Participatory Modeling (PM), and aim to explore the essential components and steps to gamify the PM process. We look at the literature on gamification, stakeholder engagement, problem structuring methods and, specifically, PM. Based on this analysis, we propose a gamification framework for PM, which includes the steps commonly mentioned in other existing frameworks and more nuanced features within each step that are specific to the PM context. Emphasis is given to analyzing the context of the gamified activity, including such aspects as participants, group interaction, and modeling. In addition, consideration of ethical points and potential risks of gamification is suggested as a necessary step to prevent undesired side effects during the gamified PM process.\n            The gamification framework for PM leads to a variety of ways in which gamified intervention can be designed and incorporated into the process. Further research on the appropriateness of gamification use, practical applications, their evaluation, and risks associated with gamified interventions can contribute to the extension and clarification of the proposed framework.","container-title":"Group Decision and Negotiation","DOI":"10.1007/s10726-023-09838-w","ISSN":"0926-2644, 1572-9907","issue":"5","journalAbbreviation":"Group

First, the growing use of these tools in a range of service occupations provides opportunities for coalitions with customers or service users focusing on technologies' impact on service quality. Second, the importance of worker knowledge and skills as both inputs to and output of new AI-based technologies provides opportunities for a more collaborative approach to improving their accuracy and performance.

As the concept spread internationally, with it came efforts to consider how such excluded groups (and the processes by which they became excluded) could be better integrated (social inclusion) in normatively accepted standards of social, economic, political and cultural activities. Efforts to theorize, model and measure these processes of social exclusion/inclusion represent an awareness that a meaningful life in any society, while embedded in economic and employment security, extends to a larger set of social dimensions or domains; and that even the economic bedrock is more than simply income poverty, whether considered in absolute or relative terms. A review of models, indicators and measures for their theoretical and empirical robustness led to identification of nine domains that capture processes of social exclusion/inclusion: employment and work, income and economic resources, material resources, education and skills, health, housing, social resources, community resources, and personal safety. Multiple indicators for each of these domains were selected, based on frequency and robustness of use. Measures from existing Canadian data sets were then identified, emphasizing those that could be disaggregated by level and other equity stratifiers. Internet summary: Processes of social exclusion and social inclusion have gained prominence in public policy discourse. This paper critically reviews the conceptual development of these terms, models and frameworks used to represent them, and indicators and measures that could be used in a Canadian context for purposes of monitoring, or for policy and program development and evaluation. Résumé Le concept de l'exclusion sociale a émergé dans les années 1970 à une époque de restructuration économique massive et de tentatives d'éviter les atteintes à la cohésion et à la stabilité sociales. Avec la diffusion de ce concept à l'échelle internationale, on a commencé à se pencher sur les processus qui mènent à l'exclusion de certains groupes et aux façons dont on pourrait assurer leur intégration dans des activités sociales, économiques, politiques et culturelles normativement acceptées (c'est-à-dire leur inclusion sociale). Les efforts en vue de théoriser, de modéliser et de mesurer les processus d'exclusion et d'inclusion sociale illustrent la conscience du fait que dans n'importe quelle société, un vaste ensemble de dimensions sociales et de domaines influent sur la capacité de vivre une vie pleine de sens, bien que la sécurité économique et la sécurité d'emploi en soient les fondements. En outre, la simple pauvreté sur le plan du revenu, que ce soit en termes relatifs ou absolus, n'est qu'un seul des facteurs économiques en jeu. L'évaluation de la solidité théorique et empirique des modèles, des indicateurs et des mesures à mené à l'identification de neuf domaines qui donnent lieu à des processus d'exclusion et d'inclusion sociale : l'emploi et le travail, le revenu et les ressources économiques, les ressources matérielles, l'éducation et les compétences, la santé, le logement, les ressources sociales, les ressources communautaires et, enfin, la sécurité personnelle. Des indicateurs multiples ont été sélectionnés pour chacun de ces domaines en fonction de leur fréquence d'utilisation et de leur robustesse.

Through collective knowledge gathering in the consortium, desk research, and a survey, PATTERN has mapped over 500 training resources covering these eight areas.  Moreover, this work was complemented by three mutual learning events and interviews to understand gaps, needs and opportunities, as well as current trends and best practices in training.\n\nThe training resources span course-type activities, such as courses, workshops, and e-learning, as well as static resources potentially useful in training, including guides, reports, recordings of webinars, etc. Both in-person and online or blended formats, and both informal and formal training, were mapped. We analysed the content themes of all training and resources mapped to identify gaps and opportunities. A subset of trainings and resources, around 250, that are digitally and freely available were quality-assessed based on their relevance, accessibility, ease of implementation and adaption, adequate structure and description of aims, goals and methods, and clear language.  We identified their strengths and weaknesses, along with gaps in training addressed, to evaluate their suitability for reuse and the opportunities for new training in the eight Open RRI themes.","DOI":"10.5281/ZENODO.10640916","language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","note":"publisher: Zenodo\nversion: 2.0","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"D1.1 Report on the analysis of existing training activities and quality assessment","URL":"https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10640916","author":[{"family":"Lagido","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Kragh","given":"Gitte"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Kristian"}],"contributor":[{"family":"Venkataraman","given":"Shanmugasundaram"},{"family":"England","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bezuidenhout","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Brinkman","given":"Loek"},{"family":"Flohr","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Skarvøy","given":"Aslak"},{"family":"Konach","given":"Teodora"},{"family":"Taraj","given":"Borana"},{"family":"Salnikova","given":"Asya"},{"family":"Brandstetter-Kunc","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Haklay","given":"Muki"},{"family":"Sevilla","given":"Andrea Giraldo"},{"family":"Cahill","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Baini","given":"Agnese"},{"family":"Saviane","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Pitrelli","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Consolini","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Fedeli","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Di Lorenzo","given":"Noemi"},{"family":"Jurković","given":"Sanja"},{"family":"Macan","given":"Bojan"},{"family":"Vodopijevec","given":"Alen"},{"family":"Correia","given":"Antónia"},{"family":"Moura","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Príncipe","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Koller","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Marschalek","given":"Ilse"},{"family":"Schrammel","given":"Maria"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"citation-key":"lagido2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"lagido2024"},{"id":"cologna2025","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            Science is crucial for evidence-based decision-making. Public trust in scientists can help decision makers act on the basis of the best available evidence, especially during crises. However, in recent years the epistemic authority of science has been challenged, causing concerns about low public trust in scientists. We interrogated these concerns with a preregistered 68-country survey of 71,922 respondents and found that in most countries, most people trust scientists and agree that scientists should engage more in society and policymaking. We found variations between and within countries, which we explain with individual- and country-level variables, including political orientation. While there is no widespread lack of trust in scientists, we cannot discount the concern that lack of trust in scientists by even a small minority may affect considerations of scientific evidence in policymaking. These findings have implications for scientists and policymakers seeking to maintain and increase trust in scientists.","container-title":"Nature Human Behaviour","DOI":"10.1038/s41562-024-02090-5","ISSN":"2397-3374","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Hum Behav","language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Trust in scientists and their role in society across 68 countries","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02090-5","author":[{"family":"Cologna","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Mede","given":"Niels G."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Besley","given":"John"},{"family":"Brick","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Joubert","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Maibach","given":"Edward W."},{"family":"Mihelj","given":"Sabina"},{"family":"Oreskes","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Van Der Linden","given":"Sander"},{"family":"Abdul Aziz","given":"Nor Izzatina"},{"family":"Abdulsalam","given":"Suleiman"},{"family":"Shamsi","given":"Nurulaini Abu"},{"family":"Aczel","given":"Balazs"},{"family":"Adinugroho","given":"Indro"},{"family":"Alabrese","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Aldoh","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Alfano","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Innocent Mbulli"},{"family":"Alsobay","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Altenmüller","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"R.

As LMS design shifts from technology-centric to user-centric, developers need to prioritize user experience (UX) to improve their LMS. LMS as part of an e-learning system can benefit from UX research to measure ease of use and user satisfaction. Many academic institutions around the world prefer to use their own customized LMS, such as: B. Moodle is an open source LMS platform built and maintained by most Jordanian universities. Therefore, UX evaluation and measurement is very important for LMS. Several studies have been conducted to analyze and measure LMS products for user feedback. On the other hand, these studies only partially consider LMS products. Instead of observing the quality of LMS, they conducted a study focused on comparing LMS and gaining awareness. The purpose of this study is to collect comments and feedback and evaluate the UX when dealing with LMS. Using Moodle as a case study, this study evaluates the user experience of LMS. Data were collected from 867 participants from various Jordanian institutions using LMS. An online survey was prepared and distributed through various social media groups. This study proposes to use the UX Survey Tool (UEQ) to evaluate and quantify the user experience of LMS. This study aims to get feedback and evaluate and identify the UX while interacting with the LMS. In general, implementing a user experience questionnaire to evaluate and evaluate an LMS provides not only complete user awareness, but also the relative quality level of the LMS. The results provide feedback and support assistance in the implementation of the LMS.","container-title":"International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)","DOI":"10.3991/ijet.v17i07.29525","ISSN":"1863-0383","issue":"07","journalAbbreviation":"Int.

Main body: This paper provides a short conceptualisation of stakeholder engagement, followed by ‘design principles’ that we put forward based on a combination of existing literature and new empirical insights from our recently completed longitudinal study of stakeholder engagement. The design principles for stakeholder engagement are organised into three groups, namely organisational, values and practices. The organisational principles are to clarify the objectives of stakeholder engagement; embed stakeholder engagement in a framework or model of research use; identify the necessary resources for stakeholder engagement; put in place plans for organisational learning and rewarding of effective stakeholder engagement; and to recognise that some stakeholders have the potential to play a key role. The principles relating to values are to foster shared commitment to the values and objectives of stakeholder engagement in the project team; share understanding that stakeholder engagement is often about more than individuals; encourage individual stakeholders and their organisations to value engagement; recognise potential tension between productivity and inclusion; and to generate a shared commitment to sustained and continuous stakeholder engagement. Finally, in terms of practices, the principles suggest that it is important to plan stakeholder engagement activity as part of the research programme of work; build flexibility within the research process to accommodate engagement and the outcomes of engagement; consider how input from stakeholders can be gathered systematically to meet objectives; consider how input from stakeholders can be collated, analysed and used; and to recognise that identification and involvement of stakeholders is an iterative and ongoing process. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the principles will be useful in planning stakeholder engagement activity within research programmes and in monitoring and evaluating stakeholder engagement. A next step will be to address the remaining gap in the stakeholder engagement literature concerned with how we assess the impact of stakeholder engagement on research use.","container-title":"Health Research Policy and Systems","DOI":"10.1186/s12961-018-0337-6","ISSN":"1478-4505","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Health Res Policy Sys","language":"en","page":"60","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How to engage stakeholders in research: design principles to support improvement","title-short":"How to engage stakeholders in research","URL":"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-018-0337-6","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Boaz","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Hanney","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Borst","given":"Robert"},{"family":"O’Shea","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Kok","given":"Maarten"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"citation-key":"boaz2018","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"boaz2018"},{"id":"huzzard2021","type":"article-journal","container-title":"European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/1359432X.2020.1761875","ISSN":"1359-432X, 1464-0643","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology","language":"en","page":"379-389","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Achieving impact: exploring the challenge of stakeholder engagement","title-short":"Achieving impact","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2020.1761875","volume":"30","author":[{"family":"Huzzard","given":"Tony"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,4]]},"citation-key":"huzzard2021","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"huzzard2021"},{"id":"ozdemir2023","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Business Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113955","ISSN":"01482963","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Business Research","language":"en","page":"113955","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stakeholder diversity and collaborative innovation: Integrating the resource-based view with stakeholder theory","title-short":"Stakeholder diversity and collaborative innovation","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0148296323003132","volume":"164","author":[{"family":"Ozdemir","given":"Sena"},{"family":"Carlos Fernandez De Arroyabe","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Sena","given":"Vania"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Suraksha"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"citation-key":"ozdemir2023","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ozdemir2023"},{"id":"flood-grady2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Background\n              Limited regulatory guidance surrounding the use of social media channels for participant recruitment is an interdisciplinary challenge.

While guidelines exist for algorithm selection and outcome evaluation, there are no firmly established ways of computing a priori statistical power for cluster analysis. Here, we estimated power and classification accuracy for common analysis pipelines through simulation. We systematically varied subgroup size, number, separation (effect size), and covariance structure. We then subjected generated datasets to dimensionality reduction approaches (none, multi-dimensional scaling, or uniform manifold approximation and projection) and cluster algorithms (k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering with Ward or average linkage and Euclidean or cosine distance, HDBSCAN). Finally, we directly compared the statistical power of discrete (k-means), “fuzzy” (c-means), and finite mixture modelling approaches (which include latent class analysis and latent profile analysis).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We found that clustering outcomes were driven by large effect sizes or the accumulation of many smaller effects across features, and were mostly unaffected by differences in covariance structure. Sufficient statistical power was achieved with relatively small samples (N = 20 per subgroup), provided cluster separation is large (Δ = 4). Finally, we demonstrated that fuzzy clustering can provide a more parsimonious and powerful alternative for identifying separable multivariate normal distributions, particularly those with slightly lower centroid separation (Δ = 3).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Traditional intuitions about statistical power only partially apply to cluster analysis: increasing the number of participants above a sufficient sample size did not improve power, but effect size was crucial. Notably, for the popular dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms tested here, power was only satisfactory for relatively large effect sizes (clear separation between subgroups). Fuzzy clustering provided higher power in multivariate normal distributions. Overall, we recommend that researchers (1) only apply cluster analysis when large subgroup separation is expected, (2) aim for sample sizes of N = 20 to N = 30 per expected subgroup, (3) use multi-dimensional scaling to improve cluster separation, and (4) use fuzzy clustering or mixture modelling approaches that are more powerful and more parsimonious with partially overlapping multivariate normal distributions.","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-022-04675-1","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"BMC Bioinformatics","language":"en","page":"205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Statistical power for cluster analysis","URL":"https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04675-1","volume":"23","author":[{"family":"Dalmaijer","given":"Edwin S."},{"family":"Nord","given":"Camilla L."},{"family":"Astle","given":"Duncan E."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"citation-key":"dalmaijer2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"dalmaijer2022"},{"id":"hogberg2019","type":"article-journal","container-title":"User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction","DOI":"10.1007/s11257-019-09223-w","ISSN":"0924-1868, 1573-1391","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"User Model User-Adap Inter","language":"en","page":"619-660","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gameful Experience Questionnaire (GAMEFULQUEST): an instrument for measuring the perceived gamefulness of system use","title-short":"Gameful Experience Questionnaire (GAMEFULQUEST)","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11257-019-09223-w","volume":"29","author":[{"family":"Högberg","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Hamari","given":"Juho"},{"family":"Wästlund","given":"Erik"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"citation-key":"hogberg2019","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"hogberg2019"},{"id":"fernandezgaleote2023","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2023.107930","ISSN":"07475632","journalAbbreviation":"Computers in Human Behavior","language":"en","page":"107930","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Text- and game-based communication for climate change attitude, self-efficacy, and behavior: A controlled experiment","title-short":"Text- and game-based communication for climate change attitude, self-efficacy, and behavior","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563223002819","volume":"149","author":[{"family":"Fernández Galeote","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Legaki","given":"Nikoletta-Zampeta"},{"family":"Hamari","given":"Juho"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"citation-key":"fernandezgaleote2023","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"fernandezgaleote2023"},{"id":"fernandezgaleote2023a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Widespread climate change engagement is needed to confront our current environmental crises, but it remains difficult to attain. Methods such as visualizations and experiential learning activities, including games and gamification, have been proposed to engage citizens beyond what generic and one-way information sharing can, but rigorous studies comparing the effects of game-based learning with traditional methods are rare. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of a serious game vs. control on learning outcomes related to climate change concepts. We conducted an experiment involving N=105 participants randomly assigned to two treatment groups (a desktop screen-based video game and an immersive VR version of the same game) and a control (a text with charts) and investigated the differences between pre- and post-intervention measures of knowledge. The results show that all three conditions had a large effect on learning, but there were no significant improvement differences between groups. Therefore, video games, either on desktop or virtual reality, may be as effective as more traditional instructional materials. Based on detailed observations of the questionnaire data, we also provide game design recommendations. Future studies could focus on specific features of learning and cognitive engagement and expand this experimental design to affect and behavior.","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","DOI":"10.1145/3611039","ISSN":"2573-0142","issue":"CHI PLAY","journalAbbreviation":"Proc.

Using an online survey, this article explores how volunteers in online citizen science experience satisfaction and dissatisfaction of needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness and how this relates to both their behaviour and motivations to take part. Results suggest that participation in online citizen science on the Zooniverse relates primarily to the satisfaction than dissatisfaction of needs, suggesting that taking part is psychologically beneficial to volunteers. Autonomy is the most supported need and relatedness the least. While results are positive, we observe that measures of need satisfaction must be contextually relevant, especially given the complex nature of autonomy in online citizen science, to aid in further understanding of these relationships. Potential factors related to participation in the Zooniverse that could be enhanced to increase volunteer satisfaction and retention are discussed.","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Social Computing","DOI":"10.1145/3702210","ISSN":"2469-7818, 2469-7826","issue":"1-2","journalAbbreviation":"Trans.

To evaluate how the data aligns with the instruments’ hypothesised structure, researchers often rely on the so-called rules of thumb, model fit cutoffs, such as RMSEA ≤ .05 or CFI ≥ .95, whose validity has been widely criticised. The cutoffs have been derived from experience or based on simulation studies. However, it is impossible to use universal cutoffs for models and data with characteristics that differ from those used in prior experience or simulations. In this paper, we offer an approach to model fit assessment grounded in conceptual understanding and situational character of the fit measures. We hope that this tutorial, together with an R script with illustrative examples and a model-fitting decision tree, may inspire fellow researchers to conduct more in-depth fit assessments and prevent the accumulation of bad-fitting models in the literature. Finally, we offer a modified version of the 21-word solution, which allows researchers to disclose their awareness of the problematic nature of the fit-index cutoffs.","DOI":"10.31219/osf.io/zkp54_v1","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","source":"Open Science Framework","title":"Abandon All Thumbs Ye Who Model: An Up-to-Date Tutorial on Fitting CFA Models","title-short":"Abandon All Thumbs Ye Who Model","URL":"https://osf.io/zkp54_v1","author":[{"family":"Palíšek","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Chvojka","given":"Edita"},{"family":"Literová","given":"Anna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,15]]},"citation-key":"palisek2025","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"palisek2025"},{"id":"alvarez-antelo2025a","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108498","ISSN":"09218009","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","language":"en","page":"108498","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards a sustainable mobility lifestyle: Exploring the flight to rail shift through model-based behavioural change scenarios","title-short":"Towards a sustainable mobility lifestyle","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800924003951","volume":"230","author":[{"family":"Álvarez-Antelo","given":"David"},{"family":"López-Muñoz","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Llases","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Lauer","given":"Arthur"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4]]},"citation-key":"alvarez-antelo2025a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"alvarez-antelo2025a"},{"id":"intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipcc2023c","type":"chapter","container-title":"Climate Change 2022 - Mitigation of Climate Change","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-009-15792-6","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","note":"DOI: 10.1017/9781009157926.022","page":"1841-1908","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Annex III: Scenarios and Modelling Methods","title-short":"Annex III","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781009157926%23bmt3/type/book_part","editor":[{"literal":"Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC)"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"citation-key":"intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipcc2023c","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipcc2023c"},{"id":"gusheva2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2024.111213","ISSN":"25890042","issue":"11","journalAbbreviation":"iScience","language":"en","page":"111213","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Past peak prominence: The changing role of integrated assessment modeling in the IPCC","title-short":"Past peak prominence","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004224024386","volume":"27","author":[{"family":"Gusheva","given":"Ema"},{"family":"Pfenninger","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Lilliestam","given":"Johan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11]]},"citation-key":"gusheva2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"gusheva2024"},{"id":"oecd2022h","type":"report","event-place":"Paris","publisher":"OECD","publisher-place":"Paris","title":"Social and solidarity economy.

Sie begegnen aktuellen gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen mit unternehmerischen Mitteln und Innovationen, und priorisieren ihre sozialen und ökologischen Ziele gegenüber einer Gewinnerzielungsabsicht. Neben ihren Wirkungen, die sie direkt für ihre Zielgruppen erzielen, sind sie inklusive, mitbestimmungsorienterte Arbeitgeber:innen und tragen zur Wertschöpfung in Österreich bei.<br/><br/>Der Austrian Social Enterprise Monitor (ASEM) 2023/2024 ist die zweite Auflage der nationalen Studie zu Sozialunternehmen in Österreich. Der ASEM präsentiert aktuelle Befunde zu den Eigenschaften, Leistungen und Bedürfnissen von Sozialunternehmen in Österreich und leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen ab. Als Teil des European Social Enterprise Monitor Projektes bietet er die Möglichkeit, Befunde auch in einen internationalen Kontext einzuordnen. Die Ergebnisse beruhen auf einer quantitativen Erhebung unter 194 Sozialunternehmen (Erhebungszeitraum 8. November 2023 und 30. Jänner 2024) sowie einer qualitativen Befragung von 30 Expert:innen aus Österreich und dem Ausland.<br/><br/><br/>15 Fakten zu Sozialunternehmen in Österreich<br/>Sozialunternehmen in Österreich …<br/><br/>1.… sind gesellschaftlich engagiert. Sie arbeiten am häufigsten in den Bereichen Gesundheit und Wohlergehen, Verringerung von Ungleichheit, Gleichstellung der Geschlechter und Bildung. Etwa die Hälfte (47,9 %) verfolgt auch oder ausschließlich ökologische Ziele, etwa im Bereich der Nachhaltigkeit und im Klimaschutz.<br/><br/>2.… sind innovativ. 83,5 % gaben an, entweder zum Zeitpunkt der Gründung oder in den letzten zwei Jahren wesentliche Innovationen in ihrer Gründung umgesetzt zu haben. Nahezu jedes zweite Sozialunternehmen (46,4 %) setzt bei seiner Arbeit auf neue Technologien wie mobile Apps oder künstliche Intelligenz.<br/><br/>3.… sind oft junge Organisationen. 47,9 % der Organisationen wurden in den letzten zehn Jahren gegründet. 38,6 % befinden sich in frühen Stadien der organisationalen Entwicklung („Seed-“, „Startup-“ oder „frühe Entwicklungsphase“).<br/><br/>4.… stellen ihre Mission an erste Stelle. 94,3 % der Organisationen reinvestieren den Großteil ihrer Gewinne bzw. schütten nicht an Eigentümer:innen aus.<br/><br/>5.… nehmen ihre Wirkung ernst. 84,5 % messen schon jetzt ihre Wirkung. Im Durchschnitt wenden sie 8,5 % ihres Budgets für Wirkungsmessung auf.<br/><br/>6.… schaffen viele (wertvolle) Jobs. Auf die Grundgesamtheit der Sozialunternehmen hochgerechnet beschäftigt der Sektor 34.000 bis 93.000 Personen, gerechnet in Vollzeitäquivalenten, mit steigender Tendenz. Oftmals werden Personen beschäftigt, die am Arbeitsmarkt schlechtere Chancen haben, wodurch die Arbeitsverhältnisse einen zusätzlichen Mehrwert mit sich bringen.<br/><br/>7.… sind weiblich und inklusiv. 50,8 % der Geschäftsführung und 47,6 % der Gründer:innen sind weiblich. 43,8 % der Sozialunternehmen beschäftigen Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen und 38,1 % Menschen aus ethnischen Minderheiten. Mitarbeiter:innen werden in 90,2 % der Organisationen in die Entscheidungsfindung eingebunden.<br/><br/>8.… treiben die ökologische Transformation voran. Die Mehrheit setzt auch innerhalb der Organisationen auf Nachhaltigkeit: 51,6 % implementieren die Prinzipien der „Circular Economy“ in ihrer Organisation, 46,4 % achten auf die ökologische Nachhaltigkeit in ihren Lieferketten.<br/><br/>9.… haben internationale Ambitionen. 34,5 % gaben an, ihre Wirkungsziele bereits auf internationaler Ebene zu erreichen, 32,0 % planen eine weitere internationale Expansion zu verwirklichen.<br/><br/>10.… stützen sich nun stärker auf private Finanzierungsquellen. Der Anteil von Markteinkommen an den Gesamteinkünften ist auf 47,7 % gestiegen.<br/><br/>11.… sind von Krisen betroffen. 79,1 % sehen das wirtschaftliche und politische Umfeld und insbesondere Inflation, die Energiekrise und den Krieg in der Ukraine als eine Hürde für ihre Arbeit. Sozialunternehmen stehen dabei, auch aufgrund ihrer Arbeit mit marginalisierten Gruppen, unter besonderem wirtschaftlichen Druck. Das äußerst sich in sinkenden Gewinnen und einem veränderten Einkaufsverhalten.<br/><br/>12.… sind resilient: 94,6 % der Unternehmen, die 2021/2022 befragt wurden, sind trotz des schwierigen Umfeldes weiterhin aktiv. Sozialunternehmen zeigen damit eine ähnlich hohe Resilienz wie der österreichische Startup-Sektor.<br/><br/>13.… werden medial wahrgenommen. Eine Auswertung von Tages- und Wochenzeitungen zeigt über die Jahre steigendes Interesse an Sozialunternehmen – wenngleich auf noch niedrigem Niveau.<br/><br/>14.… kennen das Verified Social Enterprise Label und erhoffen sich dessen Weiterentwicklung. Etwa die Hälfte der teilnehmenden Organisationen (49,7 %) haben vom Label gehört und 12,1 % haben dieses bereits verliehen bekommen. In Expert:innen-Interviews und offenen Antwortoptionen zeigt sich Potential für die Weiterentwicklung dieses Angebots.<br/><br/>15.… wünschen sich mehr Unterstützung von Politik und Ökosystem. Die Mehrheit schätzt die Unterstützung durch die Politik (69,0 %) und das Ökosystem (57,7 %) als schwach, sehr schwach oder inexistent ein. Unterstützung ist vor allem im Bereich der Finanzierung, der steuerlichen Behandlung, der Sichtbarkeit und bei Marktzugängen gewünscht.<br/><br/>Empfehlungen an Politik und Praxis<br/><br/>Österreichs Sozialunternehmen entwickeln sich trotz schwieriger ökonomischer Rahmenbedingungen positiv und leisten viel für ihre Zielgruppen, Arbeitnehmer:innen und die Gesellschaft. Die Mehrheit artikuliert im Rahmen der Studie ambitionierte Pläne für die Zukunft, identifiziert aber auch Hürden und Herausforderungen in ihrem Umfeld.<br/><br/>Um das Potential von Sozialunternehmertum in Österreich noch besser zu heben, sind daher Politik, das Unterstützungs-Ökoystem und Geldgeber:innen gefordert, geeignete Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen. Im Rahmen von Kapitel 10 des vorliegenden Berichts werden vor diesem Hintergrund 15 Maßnahmen und fünf internationale Good Practices vorgestellt, deren Umsetzung in Österreich empfohlen wird. Diese basieren auf den Ergebnissen der schriftlichen Befragung, 30 Expert:innen-Interviews und auf Policy-orientierten Arbeiten zu Sozialunternehmertum und Entrepreneurship, dem Austausch mit der #mitSinn Initiative und Empfehlungen der Vereinten Nationen (2023), OECD (2024a), International Labour Organization (2022), des Europäischen Parlaments (2022) und des Europäischen Rates (2023).<br/><br/>Zu den empfohlenen Maßnahmen zählt unter anderem – basierend auf der Forderung des Europäischen Rates (2023) – die Entwicklung einer ambitionierten politischen Strategie für Sozialunternehmertum bis November 2025, die Weiterentwicklung des Verified Social Enterprise Labels und die Stärkung privater Investitionsfinanzierung nach portugiesischem Vorbild.","language":"de","note":"dimensions: 108 pages\nDOI: 10.57938/683DD6ED-E7DB-4921-9346-79D034928B4A\nmedium: application/pdf","page":"108 pages","publisher":"Vienna University of Economics and Business","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Austrian Social Enterprise Monitor 2023/2024: Status quo und Potentiale von Sozialunternehmen in Österreich","title-short":"Austrian Social Enterprise Monitor 2023/2024","URL":"https://research.wu.ac.at/en/publications/683dd6ed-e7db-4921-9346-79d034928b4a","author":[{"family":"Vandor","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Millner","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Hobodites","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Seindl","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Matzawrakos","given":"Melina"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,8]]},"citation-key":"vandor2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"vandor2024"},{"id":"schneider2021","type":"chapter","collection-title":"Nonprofit and Civil Society Studies","container-title":"The New Social and Impact Economy: An International Perspective","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-68294-1","language":"en","license":"https://www.springer.com/tdm","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-68295-8","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The (new) social economy in Austria","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-68295-8","editor":[{"family":"Gidron","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Domaradzka","given":"Anna"}],"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Simsa","given":"Ruth"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"citation-key":"schneider2021","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"schneider2021"},{"id":"gidron2021","type":"book","collection-title":"Nonprofit and Civil Society Studies","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-68294-1","language":"en","license":"https://www.springer.com/tdm","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-68295-8","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The New Social and Impact Economy: An International Perspective","title-short":"The New Social and Impact Economy","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-68295-8","editor":[{"family":"Gidron","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Domaradzka","given":"Anna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"citation-key":"gidron2021","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"gidron2021"},{"id":"lenaerts2018","type":"report","event-place":"Brussels","publisher":"CEPS","publisher-place":"Brussels","title":"Industrial Relations and Social Dialogue in the Age of Collaborative Economy. national Report Belgium","URL":"https://cdn.ceps.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IRSDACE_BE.pdf","author":[{"family":"Lenaerts","given":"Karolien"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"citation-key":"lenaerts2018","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"lenaerts2018"},{"id":"epsu2021a","type":"report","event-place":"Brussels","publisher":"EPSU, Federation of Social Employers","publisher-place":"Brussels","title":"The importance of developing social dialogue in the social economy.

This attitude marked one of the most important missed encounters between Marxism and other theoretical currents. However, there have been important recent contributions that bring forward not only the political character of Deleuze's theoretical endeavour, his critique of capitalist social forms, his conception of social practice and struggle, but also the linkages with the Marxian and Marxist concepts.

In A Thousand Plateaus, however, the focus on the three syntheses falls away and is replaced with what the authors call the “three lines” or “three flows”. What is the place of Marx in this transition? I argue that if Deleuze and Guattari dispense with the categories of desiring production, they do not dispense with the fundamental problematic outlined by Marx, namely, the immanence of capital. This article aims to show how what Deleuze and Guattari call the “axiomatics of capital” are the semiotic forms by which the machinic processes of desiring production are deployed specifically within the capitalist mode of production. These semiotic forms are what enable capital to generate the cultural or ideological conditions by which subjectivity becomes a fundamental component of the reproduction of capital. The article suggests that, with the financial and economic crash of 2008 and its aftermath, this “subjective” reproduction of capital has been in crisis, a crisis which has brought about, amongst other things, a reassertion of State power. As capital seeks to enter into a new phase of its axiomatic, it is imperative that we extract from the crisis the semiotic components of a new politics.","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"MARX, DELEUZE, AND THE AXIOMATICS OF CAPITAL","author":[{"family":"Tynan","given":"Aidan"}],"citation-key":"tynan","library":"My Library","citekey":"tynan"},{"id":"theory&philosophy2023","type":"motion_picture","dimensions":"9:26","source":"YouTube","title":"Deleuze & Guattari vs. Marx","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf_YRVVyJxA","director":[{"literal":"Theory & Philosophy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,6]]},"citation-key":"theory&philosophy2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"theory&philosophy2023"},{"id":"laurie2015","type":"chapter","container-title":"Deleuze and the Non/Human","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-349-49775-1","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.1057/9781137453693_9","page":"142-162","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Becoming-Animal Is a Trap for Humans: Deleuze and Guattari in Madagascar","title-short":"Becoming-Animal Is a Trap for Humans","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137453693_9","editor":[{"family":"Roffe","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Hannah"}],"author":[{"family":"Laurie","given":"Timothy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"citation-key":"laurie2015","library":"My Library","citekey":"laurie2015"},{"id":"yet","type":"webpage","abstract":"We investigate the internal mechanisms used by Claude 3.5 Haiku — Anthropic's lightweight production model — in a variety of contexts, using our circuit tracing methodology.","container-title":"Transformer Circuits","language":"en","title":"On the Biology of a Large Language Model","URL":"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html","author":[{"family":"yet","given":"Authors Affiliations Published Not published yet DOI No DOI"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"citation-key":"yet","library":"My Library","citekey":"yet"},{"id":"phd2025","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"An Essay on the Convergence of Negative Differences, Icons, and the Digital Mind","container-title":"Higher Neurons","language":"en","title":"LLMs through Saussurean and Peircean Lenses","URL":"https://medium.com/higher-neurons/llms-through-saussurean-and-peircean-lenses-e64d340d1d10","author":[{"family":"PhD","given":"Michael Filimowicz"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"citation-key":"phd2025","library":"My Library","citekey":"phd2025"},{"id":"forster2022","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"c-forster.github.io","title":"Are Large Language Models Operationalizations of Saussurean Structure?","URL":"https://c-forster.github.io/2022/07/on-words/","author":[{"family":"Forster","given":"Chris"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,18]]},"citation-key":"forster2022","library":"My Library","citekey":"forster2022"},{"id":"2013h","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"A couple of weeks ago, after reading abstracts from DH2013, I said that the take-away for me was that “literary theory is about to get interesting again” – subtweeting the course of history in a wa…","container-title":"The Stone and the Shell","language":"en","title":"Interesting times for literary theory.","URL":"https://tedunderwood.com/2013/08/04/interesting-times-for-literary-theory/","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,4]]},"citation-key":"2013h","library":"My Library","citekey":"2013h"},{"id":"zotero-item-44382","type":"webpage","abstract":"A priori it would seem a generally valid thesis that for every process there is a corresponding system. — Louis Hjelmslev, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language (1943/1961, p.","language":"en","title":"AI vs Linguistics: Thoughts on LLMs as theories of language","title-short":"AI vs Linguistics","URL":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-vs-linguistics-thoughts-llms-theories-language-dylan-scott-low-%E5%8A%89%E5%B2%A9%E5%B3%BB","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"citation-key":"zotero-item-44382","library":"My Library","citekey":"zotero-item-44382"},{"id":"2019m","type":"webpage","language":"en-UK","title":"Philosophie.ch - Deleuze and capitalism: an overview","title-short":"Philosophie.ch - Deleuze and capitalism","URL":"https://www.philosophie.ch/2019-08-17-haas","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,17]]},"citation-key":"2019m","library":"My Library","citekey":"2019m"},{"id":"statistikaustria2020b","type":"report","language":"de","source":"Zotero","title":"Arbeitsunfälle und arbeitsbezogene Gesundheitsprobleme.

The Missed Nursing Care Model explains that the reasons for missed care are linked with 1) demand for patient care, 2) labor resource allocation, 3) material resource allocation, and 4) relationship and communication factors. Scientific evidence points to a lack of adequate nursing staffing as the most important factor triggering missed care. However, it remains unclear how the different theoretical reasons for missed care are interlinked with reports on missed care from the perspective of nurses in acute care settings. The aim of this study was to explore non-trivial configurations of reasons for missed care that are associated with missed care interventions from the perspective of nurses working in general units in Austrian hospitals.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A cross-sectional study was conducted.

The shortage of nursing staff in acute inpatient settings currently poses a serious threat to the maintenance of acute patient care in general wards in Austrian hospitals. Nurses in this setting already report that necessary patient care has to be omitted. This is referred to as missed nursing care. This situation has been identified in the literature as a relevant factor for nurses’ satisfaction and intention to leave the nursing profession.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The objective is to examine the current satisfaction and intention to leave the nursing profession of nurses in general wards in the acute care setting as well as to uncover the impact of known factors influencing the intention to leave the nursing profession in this setting.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The MISSCARE Austria is a quantitative cross-sectional study based on an online questionnaire with the revised MISSCARE Austria survey. Data analysis is performed using descriptive statistics as well as correlation coefficients, nonparametric group comparison tests and logistic regression analysis. Participants are nurses in general wards in Austrian hospitals.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 1006 nurses participated in the study. The majority of respondents worked full time, in rotating shifts, and longer than 10 h per shift and 80% worked overtime in the past 3 months. A positive trend in job satisfaction was observed. Nonetheless, 75% reported thinking about leaving nursing at different time intervals. A statistically significant relationship was found between missed nursing care and both job satisfaction and intention to leave the nursing profession. Important risk factors influencing the intention to leave the nursing profession were younger age (odds ratio, OR = 1.57), working as a graduate nurse (OR = 2.83), working overtime in interaction in combination with day shifts (OR = 1.04), satisfaction with being a nurse (OR = 0.04) and missed nursing care (OR = 1.56).\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Missed nursing care is an important predictor for job satisfaction and for nurses’ intention to leave the profession. Our study reinforces the relevance of further monitoring of this phenomenon in the Austrian care landscape in light of the current precarious nursing staff situation to support current nursing policy decisions.","container-title":"HeilberufeScience","DOI":"10.1007/s16024-022-00390-2","ISSN":"2190-2100","issue":"S2","journalAbbreviation":"HBScience","language":"de","page":"61-78","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie – Teil III: Missed Nursing Care auf Allgemeinstationen in österreichischen Krankenhäusern: Einfluss auf die Arbeitszufriedenheit und auf die Absicht, den Beruf zu verlassen","title-short":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie – Teil III","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s16024-022-00390-2","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Cartaxo","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Eberl","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Hanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"citation-key":"cartaxo2022a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"cartaxo2022a"},{"id":"cartaxo2022b","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Zusammenfassung\n            \n              Hintergrund\n              \n                Studien zufolge müssen Pflegepersonen im Krankenhaus u. a. aufgrund von Ressourcenknappheit notwendige Pflegetätigkeiten weglassen bzw. können diese nur mit einer für die Patient*innen nachteiligen Verzögerung durchführen.

Die häufigsten Einflussfaktoren auf MNC sind Multitasking, häufige Unterbrechungen, Personalmangel, gesteigerter Versorgungsaufwand, gesteigerte Aufnahme- und Entlassungsdynamiken sowie die eigene Erschöpfung und mangelnde Unterstützung von den direkten Vorgesetzten.\n              \n            \n            \n              Schlussfolgerung\n              MNC wurde erstmalig in österreichischen Krankenhäusern erfasst. Die Ergebnisse geben deutliche Hinweise auf implizite Rationierung der akuten Versorgung. Die identifizierten Einflussfaktoren sollten bei der zukünftigen Entwicklung von Strategien für die Sicherung der Versorgungsqualität im akuten Bereich berücksichtigt werden.\n            \n          , \n            Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              According to multiple studies nurses in hospital settings have to omit necessary care that is detrimental for patient safety, mainly due to a shortage of resources. This phenomenon is described as missed nursing care (MNC, Kalisch et al. 2009). In Austria, there is a lack of valid data on this issue.\n            \n            \n              Objectives\n              To survey MNC in Austrian hospitals and to identify relevant influencing factors. A further aim is to investigate differences in MNC according to hospital and ward characteristics as well as according to nurses’ sociodemographic and working characteristics.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Quantitative descriptive comparative cross-sectional study using the online version of the Austrian version of the revised MISSCARE instrument. The sample consisted of all nurses working in general wards in Austrian hospitals during this period. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients and nonparametric group comparison tests.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                A total of 1006 nurses participated in the study and met the inclusion criteria. Of these 84.4% (\n                n\n                 = 849) reported that at least 1 nursing intervention related to acute patient care was omitted in the previous 2 weeks. This mainly concerns interventions related to emotional support, counselling and education. Especially younger nurses (\n                p\n                 < 0.001), nurses working in larger wards (\n                p\n                 < 0.001), with a full-time employment (\n                p\n                 = 0.036), and less professional experience (\n                p\n                 < 0.001) as well as graduated nurses in direct patient care (\n                p\n                 = 0.003) reported higher levels of MNC. The most common factors influencing MNC were multitasking and frequent interruptions, staff shortages, increased care demands and increased admissions and discharge dynamics as well as the own exhaustion and a lack of support from direct ward managers.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Missed nursing care was identified for the first time in Austrian hospitals—evidence regarding implicit rationing in acute nursing care could be gained through this study. Identified influencing factors should be considered in further strategies for ensuring the quality of care in the Austrian acute health care sector.","container-title":"HeilberufeScience","DOI":"10.1007/s16024-022-00387-x","ISSN":"2190-2100","issue":"S2","journalAbbreviation":"HBScience","language":"de","page":"30-42","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie – Teil I: Häufigkeit von Missed Nursing Care und assoziierten Einflussfaktoren auf Allgemeinstationen in österreichischen Krankenhäusern","title-short":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie – Teil I","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s16024-022-00387-x","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Cartaxo","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Eberl","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Hanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"citation-key":"cartaxo2022b","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"cartaxo2022b"},{"id":"cartaxo2022c","type":"article-journal","container-title":"HeilberufeScience","DOI":"10.1007/s16024-022-00388-w","ISSN":"2190-2100","issue":"S2","journalAbbreviation":"HBScience","language":"de","page":"27-29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie: Einführende Überlegungen: Missed Nursing Care aus der internationalen und österreichischen Perspektive","title-short":"Die MISSCARE-Austria-Studie","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s16024-022-00388-w","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Cartaxo","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Eberl","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Hanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"citation-key":"cartaxo2022c","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"cartaxo2022c"},{"id":"cartaxo2023a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Zusammenfassung. Hintergrund: Fragebogenübersetzungen in der deutschsprachigen Pflegewissenschaft setzen trotz zunehmender Kritik auf Methoden mit Erst- und Rückübersetzung. Dem entgegen wird die TRAPD-Methode als best practice anerkannt. Erfahrungswerte mit der Anwendung dieser Methode in der deutschsprachigen Pflegewissenschaft fehlen jedoch. Ziel: Die Anwendung der TRAPD-Methode am Bespiel der Übersetzung vom revised MISSCARE Survey vom Englischen ins Deutsche darzustellen sowie notwendige Adaptierungen, Vorteile und Limitationen der Methode zu diskutieren. Methode: Eine adaptierte Version der teambasierten Übersetzungsmethode TRAPD durch die Schritte Vorbereitung, Übersetzung, Review, Adjudikation, Prätest und Dokumentation wurde umgesetzt, basierend auf den GESIS Guidelines für Fragebogengestaltung und Übersetzung. Ergebnisse: Das revised MISSCARE Austria Instrument besteht aus 85 Items. Für die Mehrzahl der Items wurden äquivalente Termini gefunden, die eine eindeutige Übersetzung ermöglichten. Bei einzelnen Items wurde eine Adaptierung aus kulturellen, Messung- und Konstrukt-bezogenen Gründen notwendig. Die Äquivalenz der Übersetzung wurde bei komplexen Items mit der Entwicklerin geprüft und durch mehrmalige kognitive Prätests mit Pflegepersonen gefördert. Schlussfolgerungen: Die Studie bestärkt die Aussage, dass die TRAPD-Methode für die Übersetzung von Messinstrumenten ebenfalls in der deutschsprachigen Pflegewissenschaft geeignet ist. Sie zeigt aber auch, dass weitere Erfahrungen für eine Weiterentwicklung von methodischen Spezifika für unsere Disziplin erforderlich sind.","container-title":"Pflege","DOI":"10.1024/1012-5302/a000936","ISSN":"1012-5302, 1664-283X","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Pflege","language":"de","page":"228-237","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Übersetzung des revised MISSCARE Survey zum deutschsprachigen revised MISSCARE-Austria: Anwendung der TRAPD-Methode","title-short":"Übersetzung des revised MISSCARE Survey zum deutschsprachigen revised MISSCARE-Austria","URL":"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1024/1012-5302/a000936","volume":"36","author":[{"family":"Cartaxo","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Eberl","given":"Inge"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Hanna"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8]]},"citation-key":"cartaxo2023a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"cartaxo2023a"},{"id":"europeancommission2022","type":"document","publisher":"European Commission Brussels","source":"Google Scholar","title":"Methodology for the Implementation of a Circular Economy at the Local and Regional Scale","author":[{"family":"European Commission","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"citation-key":"europeancommission2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"europeancommission2022"},{"id":"just-grocery-22292025","type":"post","container-title":"r/ControlProblem","genre":"Reddit Post","title":"Powerful intuition pump about how it feels to lose to AGI - by Connor Leahy","URL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/1kfelvp/powerful_intuition_pump_about_how_it_feels_to/","author":[{"family":"Just-Grocery-2229","given":""}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"citation-key":"just-grocery-22292025","library":"My Library","citekey":"just-grocery-22292025"},{"id":"guresen2011","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Procedia Computer Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.071","ISSN":"18770509","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Computer Science","language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"426-433","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Definition of artificial neural networks with comparison to other networks","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050910004461","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Guresen","given":"Erkam"},{"family":"Kayakutlu","given":"Gulgun"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"citation-key":"guresen2011","library":"My Library","citekey":"guresen2011"},{"id":"cao2023a","type":"article","abstract":"Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2303.04226","license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","note":"version: 1","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT","title-short":"A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC)","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04226","author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Yihan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Siyu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yixin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Zhiling"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Yutong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Philip S."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Lichao"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"citation-key":"cao2023a","library":"My Library","citekey":"cao2023a"},{"id":"mannarini2013","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Community Development","DOI":"10.1080/15575330.2012.683799","ISSN":"1557-5330, 1944-7485","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Community Development","language":"en","page":"239-256","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evaluating public participation: instruments and implications for citizen involvement","title-short":"Evaluating public participation","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15575330.2012.683799","volume":"44","author":[{"family":"Mannarini","given":"Terri"},{"family":"Talò","given":"Cosimo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"citation-key":"mannarini2013","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"mannarini2013"},{"id":"carini2024","type":"report","abstract":"This report summarises the findings of the project ‘Benchmarking the socio-economic performance of the EU social economy’. Across the 27 Member States, the social economy includes more than 4.3 million entities1. Social economy entities are mainly cooperatives, mutual benefit societies, associations and foundations. Within these figures, there are more than 246 000 social enterprises, of which almost 43 000 are ex lege and over 203 000 are de facto social enterprises2. At least 11.5 million people3 – 6.3% of the employed population in the EU – are occupied in the social economy. More than 6.2 million people (54%) are employed in associations and 3.3 million (29%) in cooperatives. Social enterprises employ at least 3.9 million people. At least 3.3 million people are employed in the health and social care sector, a further 702 000 in education and 622 000 in arts, culture and entertainment. Even if data on female employment is not always available, the share of female employment can be expected to be rather high. In Belgium and Portugal, women account for more than 70% of employment in the social economy, while in France, Poland and Italy the shares are 66%, 60% and 46%, respectively. The revenues generated by the social economy accounted at least for a turnover of EUR 912 billion in 2021. France, Italy, Spain and Finland account for the largest cooperative sectors in terms of turnover, predominantly driven by agricultural, consumer and worker cooperatives. France and Germany register the highest turnover for associations, foundations and mutuals. The social economy plays an important role in other industrial ecosystems. Its contribution to the health ecosystem is significant. It is also well positioned in the agri-food, retail and energy-renewables ecosystems, while it is emerging in the cultural and creative industries and in the tourism ecosystem. The capacity of the social economy to influence policies is very diverse, ranging from almost insignificant in some ecosystems (e.g. tourism) to extremely relevant (e.g. health, energy-renewables).","call-number":"EA-02-24-285-EN-N","event-place":"Luxembourg","language":"eng","publisher":"Publications Office of the European Union","publisher-place":"Luxembourg","source":"Publications Office of the European Union","title":"Benchmarking the socio-economic performance of the EU social economy: improving the socio economic knowledge of the proximity and social economy ecosystem","title-short":"Benchmarking the socio-economic performance of the EU social economy","URL":"https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2826/880860","author":[{"family":"Carini","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Galera","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Tallarini","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Chaves Avila","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Sak","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Schoenmaeckers","given":"Jérôme"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"citation-key":"carini2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"carini2024"},{"id":"zeglovits2022","type":"report","event-place":"Wien","publisher":"GPA-djp","publisher-place":"Wien","title":"Aktionswoche 2022: Gewalt und Aggression am Arbeitsplatz","author":[{"family":"Zeglovits","given":"Eva"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"citation-key":"zeglovits2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"zeglovits2022"},{"id":"zandonella2022","type":"report","event-place":"Linz","publisher":"AK Oberösterreich","publisher-place":"Linz","title":"Zur psychosozialen Situation der Oberösterreicher*innen während der Pandemie","URL":"https://ooe.arbeiterkammer.at/service/presse/KOM_2022_SORA_22017_Bericht_Psychosoziale_Situation_der_Ober.pdf","author":[{"family":"Zandonella","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Hoser","given":"Bernhard"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"citation-key":"zandonella2022","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"zandonella2022"},{"id":"schoenherr2025","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"Vor fünf Jahren trat der erste Lockdown zur Eindämmung des Corona-Virus in Kraft.

Conscious robots, when and if they emerge, will have profoundly different embodiments than humans. Fictions that imagine conscious robots thus face a similar challenge presented by the GPT-3 texts: will they gloss over the differences, or will they enact strategies that articulate the differences and explore their implications for humans immersed in algorithmic cultures? The author analyzes three contemporary novels that engage with this challenge: Annalee Newitz’s Autonomous (2017), Kuzuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun (2021), and Ian McEwan’s Machines like Me (2019). Each interrogates how the human aura is subverted by conscious robots.

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training","author":[{"family":"Radford","given":"Alec"},{"family":"Narasimhan","given":"Karthik"},{"family":"Salimans","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"}],"citation-key":"radford","library":"My Library","citekey":"radford"},{"id":"denton2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In response to growing concerns of bias, discrimination, and unfairness perpetuated by algorithmic systems, the datasets used to train and evaluate machine learning models have come under increased scrutiny.

In this work, we conceptualize machine learning datasets as a type of informational infrastructure, and motivate a genealogy as method in examining the histories and modes of constitution at play in their creation. We present a critical history of ImageNet as an exemplar, utilizing critical discourse analysis of major texts around ImageNet’s creation and impact. We find that assumptions around ImageNet and other large computer vision datasets more generally rely on three themes: the aggregation and accumulation of more data, the computational construction of meaning, and making certain types of data labor invisible. By tracing the discourses that surround this influential benchmark, we contribute to the ongoing development of the standards and norms around data development in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517211035955","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"Big Data & Society","language":"en","page":"20539517211035955","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets: A critical history of ImageNet","title-short":"On the genealogy of machine learning datasets","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211035955","volume":"8","author":[{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Amironesei","given":"Razvan"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Nicole","given":"Hilary"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"citation-key":"denton2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"denton2021"},{"id":"foucault2009a","type":"book","abstract":"This book derives from Foucault's lectures at the College de France between January and April 1978, which can be seen as a radical turning point in his thought.

This underscores the need for significant lifestyle changes to mitigate this impact. Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) change involves adopting actions that protect the environment and reducing environmentally harmful activities to promote sustainability. While qualitative research may provide unique insights into PEB barriers that are challenging to capture through quantitative methods, reports of qualitative studies are scattered across different literatures with little integration. With the present review, we bring together qualitative studies on PEB barriers and examine whether those studies reveal barriers compatible with existing barrier frameworks from environmental psychology. We identified 38 qualitative studies on barriers to PEB change. Our analysis revealed that most of the barriers to individual pro-environmental action identified in qualitative studies align with environmental psychology frameworks. These barriers were experienced not only by individuals in their role as consumer or citizen, but also by community-level actors (e.g., seeking to implement pro-environmental policies) and industrial decision-makers (e.g., aiming to reduce the ecological footprint of their business activities). Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of barriers to PEB change and emphasize the importance of addressing structural and institutional factors alongside individual-level interventions.","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su16208776","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"20","journalAbbreviation":"Sustainability","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"8776","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Barriers to Pro-Environmental Behavior Change: A Review of Qualitative Research","title-short":"Barriers to Pro-Environmental Behavior Change","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/20/8776","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Dioba","given":"Albina"},{"family":"Kroker","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Dewitte","given":"Siegfried"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Florian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,11]]},"citation-key":"dioba2024a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"dioba2024a"},{"id":"piao2024","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-024-03790-z","ISSN":"2662-9992","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Humanit Soc Sci Commun","language":"en","page":"1293","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Determinants of pro-environmental behaviour: effects of socioeconomic, subjective, and psychological well-being factors from 37 countries","title-short":"Determinants of pro-environmental behaviour","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03790-z","volume":"11","author":[{"family":"Piao","given":"Xiangdan"},{"family":"Managi","given":"Shunsuke"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,27]]},"citation-key":"piao2024","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"piao2024"},{"id":"morren2016","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.05.003","ISSN":"02724944","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","language":"en","page":"91-106","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Explaining environmental behavior across borders: A meta-analysis","title-short":"Explaining environmental behavior across borders","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494416300391","volume":"47","author":[{"family":"Morren","given":"Meike"},{"family":"Grinstein","given":"Amir"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9]]},"citation-key":"morren2016","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"morren2016"},{"id":"brick2017","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.04.004","ISSN":"02724944","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","language":"en","page":"226-238","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"“Green to be seen” and “brown to keep down”: Visibility moderates the effect of identity on pro-environmental behavior","title-short":"“Green to be seen” and “brown to keep down”","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494417300543","volume":"51","author":[{"family":"Brick","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Sherman","given":"David K."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Heejung S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"citation-key":"brick2017","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"brick2017"},{"id":"bamberg2007","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.12.002","ISSN":"02724944","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"14-25","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Twenty years after Hines, Hungerford, and Tomera: A new meta-analysis of psycho-social determinants of pro-environmental behaviour","title-short":"Twenty years after Hines, Hungerford, and Tomera","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494406000909","volume":"27","author":[{"family":"Bamberg","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Möser","given":"Guido"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3]]},"citation-key":"bamberg2007","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"bamberg2007"},{"id":"moser2018a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Earlier research has yielded contradictory results as to the main drivers of environmentally significant behavior.

Data from a German survey ( N = 1,012) enabled assessment of per capita energy use, and individual carbon footprints (impact-related measures), pro-environmental behavior (an intent-related measure), and behavior indicators varying in environmental impact and intent. Regression analyses revealed people’s environmental self-identity to be the main predictor of pro-environmental behavior; however, environmental self-identity played an ambiguous role in predicting actual environmental impacts. Instead, environmental impacts were best predicted by people’s income level. Our results show that individuals with high pro-environmental self-identity intend to behave in an ecologically responsible way, but they typically emphasize actions that have relatively small ecological benefits.","container-title":"Environment and Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/0013916517710685","ISSN":"0013-9165, 1552-390X","issue":"6","journalAbbreviation":"Environment and Behavior","language":"en","page":"626-656","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Good Intents, but Low Impacts: Diverging Importance of Motivational and Socioeconomic Determinants Explaining Pro-Environmental Behavior, Energy Use, and Carbon Footprint","title-short":"Good Intents, but Low Impacts","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916517710685","volume":"50","author":[{"family":"Moser","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Kleinhückelkotten","given":"Silke"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"citation-key":"moser2018a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"moser2018a"},{"id":"nielsen2022a","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Nature Sustainability","DOI":"10.1038/s41893-022-00888-7","ISSN":"2398-9629","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Sustain","language":"en","page":"665-668","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The motivation–impact gap in pro-environmental clothing consumption","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00888-7","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Kristian S."},{"family":"Brick","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Wilhelm"},{"family":"Joanes","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Gwozdz","given":"Wencke"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,12]]},"citation-key":"nielsen2022a","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"nielsen2022a"},{"id":"nielsen2021c","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101559","ISSN":"02724944","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Psychology","language":"en","page":"101559","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The case for impact-focused environmental psychology","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494421000128","volume":"74","author":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Kristian S."},{"family":"Cologna","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Brick","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Stern","given":"Paul C."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"citation-key":"nielsen2021c","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"nielsen2021c"},{"id":"shove2010d","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In this short and deliberately provocative paper I reflect on what seems to be a yawning gulf between the potential contribution of the social sciences and the typically restricted models and concepts of social change embedded in contemporary environmental policy in the UK, and in other countries too.

In this article, an environmentally significant measure of household consumer behavior (i.e., combined direct and indirect energy use) is presented and compared with a common social science measure of proenvironmental behavior (based on popular notions of environmentally significant behavior). Two large-scale field studies were conducted among representative samples of Dutch households. The results showed respondents who indicate they behave more proenvironmentally do not necessarily use less energy. Also, proenvironmental behavior is more strongly related to attitudinal variables, whereas household energy use is primarily related to variables such as income and household size.

In this pre-registered meta-analysis of 49 studies (n = 150,221 participants), we assess the impact of sustainability labeling on observable consumer behaviors. Before adjusting for publication bias, labeling shows a small-to-moderate effect (d = 0.25; 95% CI: [0.17, 0.32]) that is stronger online (d = 0.31; [0.22, 0.40]) than offline (d = 0.07; [0.01, 0.13]). After correcting for publication bias, the effects substantially diminish overall (d = 0.13; [0.05, 0.22]) and online (d = 0.20; [0.10, 0.30]), and become negligible offline (d = 0.05; [-0.07, 0.16]). Thus, current evidence likely overstates the behavioral impact of sustainability labeling, particularly in physical retail contexts. Although labeling may indirectly influence long-term behaviors and institutional purchasing decisions, more ambitious initiatives are required to meaningfully shift consumer behaviors toward sustainability at scale.","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-6557928/v1","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","source":"In Review","title":"A meta-analysis of the real-world impact of sustainability labeling on consumer choices","URL":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6557928/v1","author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Jianing"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Ziqian"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Jinquan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Constantino","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Kristian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"citation-key":"ding2025","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"ding2025"},{"id":"schmitt2020","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract\n            As awareness of climate change and its consequences increases, many have asked, “Why aren't people taking action?” Some psychologists have provided an answer that we describe as a “psychological barriers explanation” (PBE). The PBE suggests that human nature is limited in ways that create psychological barriers to taking action on climate change. Taking a critical social psychology approach (e.g., Adams, 2014), we offer a critique of the PBE, arguing that locating the causes of inaction at the psychological level promotes a misrepresentation of human nature as static and disconnected from context. Barriers to environmental action certainly exist, and most if not all involve psychological processes. However, locating the barrier itself at the psychological level ignores the complex interplay between psychological tendencies, social relations, and social structures. We consider the ways in which psychological responses to climate change are contingent upon social‐structural context, with particular attention to the ways unequal distributions of power have allowed elites to block climate action, in part by using their power to influence societal beliefs and norms. In conclusion, we suggest that psychologists interested in climate (in)action expand their scope beyond individual consumer behaviors to include psychological questions that challenge existing power relations and raise the possibility of transformative social change.","container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/josi.12360","ISSN":"0022-4537, 1540-4560","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Social Issues","language":"en","page":"123-135","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Perils of Explaining Climate Inaction in Terms of Psychological Barriers","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/josi.12360","volume":"76","author":[{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Michael T."},{"family":"Neufeld","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Caroline M.

Developing DGMs has become one of the most hotly researched fields in artificial intelligence in recent years. The literature on DGMs has become vast and is growing rapidly. Some advances have even reached the public sphere, for example, the recent successes in generating realistic‐looking images, voices, or movies; so‐called deep fakes. Despite these successes, several mathematical and practical issues limit the broader use of DGMs: given a specific dataset, it remains challenging to design and train a DGM and even more challenging to find out why a particular model is or is not effective. To help advance the theoretical understanding of DGMs, we introduce DGMs and provide a concise mathematical framework for modeling the three most popular approaches: normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these basic approaches using numerical experiments. Our goal is to enable and motivate the reader to contribute to this proliferating research area. Our presentation also emphasizes relations between generative modeling and optimal transport.","container-title":"GAMM-Mitteilungen","DOI":"10.1002/gamm.202100008","ISSN":"0936-7195, 1522-2608","issue":"2","journalAbbreviation":"GAMM-Mitteilungen","language":"en","page":"e202100008","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An introduction to deep generative modeling","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gamm.202100008","volume":"44","author":[{"family":"Ruthotto","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Haber","given":"Eldad"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"citation-key":"ruthotto2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"ruthotto2021"},{"id":"nvidia2023","type":"motion_picture","dimensions":"1:05","source":"YouTube","title":"Fireside Chat with Ilya Sutskever and Jensen Huang: AI Today and Vision of the Future","title-short":"Fireside Chat with Ilya Sutskever and Jensen Huang","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yquJiNKlAE","director":[{"literal":"NVIDIA"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"citation-key":"nvidia2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"nvidia2023"},{"id":"krizhevsky2012","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes.

In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.

When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders – from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic – with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data.","container-title":"Review of International Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0260210522000031","ISSN":"0260-2105, 1469-9044","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Rev.

In Proxies, Dylan Mulvin examines how we arrive at those standards, asking, “To whom and to what do we delegate the power to stand in for the world?” Mulvin shows how those with the power to design technology, in the very moment of design, are allowed to imagine who is included—and who is excluded—in the future.\n            For designers of technology, some bits of the world end up standing in for other bits, standards with which they build and calibrate. These “proxies” carry specific values, even as they disappear from view. Mulvin explores the ways technologies, standards, and infrastructures inescapably reflect the cultural milieus of their bureaucratic homes. Drawing on archival research, he investigates some of the basic building-blocks of our shared infrastructures. He tells the history of technology through the labor and communal practices of, among others, the people who clean kilograms to make the metric system run, the women who pose as test images, and the actors who embody disease and disability for medical students. Each case maps the ways standards and infrastructure rely on prototypical ideas of whiteness, able-bodiedness, and purity to control and contain the messiness of reality. Standards and infrastructures, Mulvin argues, shape and distort the possibilities of representation, the meaning of difference, and the levers of change and social justice.\n            The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.","ISBN":"978-0-262-36624-3","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","note":"DOI: 10.7551/mitpress/11765.001.0001","publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Proxies: The Cultural Work of Standing In","title-short":"Proxies","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/5154/ProxiesThe-Cultural-Work-of-Standing-In","author":[{"family":"Mulvin","given":"Dylan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,17]]},"citation-key":"mulvin2021","library":"My Library","citekey":"mulvin2021"},{"id":"crary2001","type":"book","collection-title":"October Books","edition":"1.

We introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers share components like training data or speciﬁc models, then they will produce more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e. models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we ﬁnd that for both vision and language settings, the speciﬁc methods for adapting a foundation model signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the degree of outcome homogenization.

We present the first work towards understanding this new system design space for multi-modal text-to-image (TTI) and text-to-video (TTV) generation models. Current model architecture designs are bifurcated into 2 categories: Diffusion- and Transformer-based models. Our systematic performance characterization on a suite of eight representative TTI/TTV models shows that after state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as Flash Attention are applied, Convolution accounts for up to 44% of execution time for Diffusion-based TTI models, while Linear layers consume up to 49% of execution time for Transformer-based models. We additionally observe that Diffusion-based TTI models resemble the Prefill stage of LLM inference, and benefit from 1.1-2.5x greater speedup from Flash Attention than Transformer-based TTI models that resemble the Decode phase. Since optimizations designed for LLMs do not map directly onto TTI/TTV models, we must conduct a thorough characterization of these workloads to gain insights for new optimization opportunities. In doing so, we define sequence length in the context of TTI/TTV models and observe sequence length can vary up to 4x in Diffusion model inference. We additionally observe temporal aspects of TTV workloads pose unique system bottlenecks, with Temporal Attention accounting for over 60% of total Attention time. Overall, our in-depth system performance characterization is a critical first step towards designing efficient and deployable systems for emerging TTI/TTV workloads.","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2312.14385","note":"arXiv:2312.14385 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2312.14385","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Generative AI Beyond LLMs: System Implications of Multi-Modal Generation","title-short":"Generative AI Beyond LLMs","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14385","author":[{"family":"Golden","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Hsia","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Acun","given":"Bilge"},{"family":"Hosmer","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yejin"},{"family":"DeVito","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Gu-Yeon"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"David"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Carole-Jean"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,6]]},"citation-key":"golden2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"golden2024"},{"id":"monti2024a","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are generative AI systems capable of producing original texts based on inputs about topic and style provided in the form of prompts or questions.

OpenAI’s language-generation program GPT-3 illustrates the challenges of interpreting algorithmic-generated texts. This article advocates interpretive strategies that recognize the profound differences (in the case of GPT-3) of language that issues from a program that has a model only of language, not of the world. Conscious robots, when and if they emerge, will have profoundly different embodiments than humans. Fictions that imagine conscious robots thus face a similar challenge presented by the GPT-3 texts: will they gloss over the differences, or will they enact strategies that articulate the differences and explore their implications for humans immersed in algorithmic cultures? The author analyzes three contemporary novels that engage with this challenge: Annalee Newitz’s Autonomous (2017), Kuzuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun (2021), and Ian McEwan’s Machines like Me (2019). Each interrogates how the human aura is subverted by conscious robots.

Case studies of AI applications from the fields of finance, medicine, commerce and manufacturing elucidate how this capitalist context shapes the aims and objectives of these innovations. The early sections of the paper set out a more-than-human theoretical perspective on capitalism, to show how the accumulation of capital depends upon free flows of commodities, money and labour, and more-than-human forces associated with supply and demand. The paper concludes that while there will be many future applications of AI, it is already in thrall to capitalist enterprise. The primary social significance of AI is that it enhances capital accumulation and a capitalist ‘black hole’ that draws more and more human activity into its sphere of influence. AI has consequent negative social, political and environmental capacities, including financial uncertainty, waste, and social inequalities. Some ways to contain and even subvert these negative consequences of an AI-fuelled capitalism are suggested.","container-title":"Social Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/socsci13100507","ISSN":"2076-0760","issue":"10","journalAbbreviation":"Social Sciences","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"507","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Artificial Intelligence and the Black Hole of Capitalism: A More-than-Human Political Ethology","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence and the Black Hole of Capitalism","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/13/10/507","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Fox","given":"Nick J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,27]]},"citation-key":"fox2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"fox2024"},{"id":"eloff2021","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Deleuze's Postscript on the Societies of Control has been the most common entry point for interrogating the ways in which contemporary digital technologies have altered the social and the subjective from a Deleuzo-Guattarian perspective.

Its argumentative core boils down to the promotion of intersectional egalitarianism (socio-economic, gender, racial-ethnic, environmental) through digital inclusion, which seems only feasible to us from a perspective capable of accommodating the normative claims of a critical decolonial theory combined with a naturalistic view of sustainability, within a research program that I dubbed “mitigated social constructionism” in response to the phenomenological deficit of normative and naturalistic theories (including critical theory and neurophilosophy). If what matters is normativity, then to avoid the divide between naturalism and non-naturalist normativity one nonfoundationalist alternative is to resort to hermeneutical and procedural accounts of normativity as helpful clues to making sense of the naturalism-normativity problem, avoiding reductionist interpretations of both naturalism (Churchland) and normativism (Parfit).","container-title":"Filosofia Unisinos","DOI":"10.4013/fsu.2024.251.14","ISSN":"1984-8234, 1519-5023","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"RFU","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"1-18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A decolonial critical theory of artificial intelligence: intersectional egalitarianism, moral alignment, and AI governance","title-short":"A decolonial critical theory of artificial intelligence","URL":"https://revistas.unisinos.br/index.php/filosofia/article/view/27076","volume":"25","author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Nythamar H.

We proceed as follows: after offering a review of cognitivism and neuro-representationalism in the field of deep learning, we first elaborate a phenomenological critique of these positions; we then sketch out computational phenomenology and distinguish it from existing alternatives; finally we apply this new method to deep learning models trained on specific tasks, in order to formulate a conceptual framework of deep-learning, that allows one to think of artificial neural networks’ mechanisms in terms of lived experience.","container-title":"Minds and Machines","DOI":"10.1007/s11023-023-09638-w","ISSN":"0924-6495, 1572-8641","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Minds & Machines","language":"en","page":"397-427","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Alternative to Cognitivism: Computational Phenomenology for Deep Learning","title-short":"An Alternative to Cognitivism","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11023-023-09638-w","volume":"33","author":[{"family":"Beckmann","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Köstner","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Hipólito","given":"Inês"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"citation-key":"beckmann2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"beckmann2023"},{"id":"hellstrom2024","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper presents a taxonomy of agents’ embodiment in physical and virtual environments.

The taxonomy is applied to a wide range of embodiment of humans, artifacts, and programs, including recent technological and scientific innovations related to virtual reality, augmented reality, telepresence, the metaverse, digital twins, and large language models. The presented taxonomy is a powerful tool to analyze, clarify, and compare complex cases of embodiment. For example, it makes the choice between a dualistic and non-dualistic perspective of an agent’s embodiment explicit and clear. The taxonomy also aided us to formulate the term “embodiment by proxy” to denote how seemingly non-embodied agents may affect the world by using humans as “extended arms”.

In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more.

How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal.","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2406.03689","note":"arXiv:2406.03689 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2406.03689","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689","author":[{"family":"Vafa","given":"Keyon"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Justin Y."},{"family":"Rambachan","given":"Ashesh"},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Mullainathan","given":"Sendhil"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,10]]},"citation-key":"vafa2024","library":"My Library","citekey":"vafa2024"},{"id":"tacheva2023","type":"article-journal","abstract":"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to captivate the collective imagination through the latest generation of generative AI models such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, the dehumanizing and harmful features of the technology industry that have plagued it since its inception only seem to deepen and intensify. Far from a “glitch” or unintentional error, these endemic issues are a function of the interlocking systems of oppression upon which AI is built. Using the analytical framework of “Empire,” this paper demonstrates that we live not simply in the “age of AI” but in the age of AI Empire. Specifically, we show that this networked and distributed global order is rooted in heteropatriarchy, racial capitalism, white supremacy, and coloniality and perpetuates its influence through the mechanisms of extractivism, automation, essentialism, surveillance, and containment. Therefore, we argue that any attempt at reforming AI from within the same interlocking oppressive systems that created it is doomed to failure and, moreover, risks exacerbating existing harm. Instead, to advance justice, we must radically transform not just the technology itself, but our ideas about it, and develop it from the bottom up, from the perspectives of those who stand the most risk of being harmed.","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517231219241","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","note":"publisher: SAGE Publications","source":"Crossref","title":"AI Empire: Unraveling the interlocking systems of oppression in generative AI's global order","title-short":"AI Empire","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517231219241","volume":"10","author":[{"family":"Tacheva","given":"Jasmina"},{"family":"Ramasubramanian","given":"Srividya"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7]]},"citation-key":"tacheva2023","library":"My Library","citekey":"tacheva2023"},{"id":"rouvroya","type":"article-journal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"ALGORITHMIC GOVERNMENTALITY AND PROSPECTS OF EMANCIPATION","author":[{"family":"Rouvroy","given":"Antoinette"},{"family":"Berns","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"rouvroya","library":"My Library","citekey":"rouvroya"},{"id":"2024c","type":"post-weblog","abstract":"Continuing on the same theme from the last two posts, this one is also about interpretability.

Migrants' job quality is noticeably lower regarding contractual terms of employment, working hours, work–life balance, multidimensional deprivation and job satisfaction. Migrants who started a platform job immediately after arriving in Poland are particularly deprived. They also cluster on taxi platforms, which offer inferior working conditions compared to delivery platforms. The platform economy can be an arrival infrastructure for migrants. However, in New Immigration Destinations such as Poland, where the ethnic economy is underdeveloped and institutional support for migrants is weak, poor working conditions on platforms can exacerbate migrants' labour market vulnerabilities and hinder mobility to better jobs, as platforms often provide limited opportunities for skill development.","container-title":"New Technology, Work and Employment","DOI":"10.1111/ntwe.12322","ISSN":"0268-1072, 1468-005X","journalAbbreviation":"New Technol Work Employ","language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","note":"publisher: Wiley","source":"Crossref","title":"Job Quality Gaps Between Migrant and Native Platform Workers: Evidence From Poland","title-short":"Job Quality Gaps Between Migrant and Native Platform Workers","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ntwe.12322","author":[{"family":"Kowalik","given":"Zuzanna"},{"family":"Lewandowski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Kaczmarczyk","given":"Paweł"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"citation-key":"kowalik2025","library":"ZSI_Library","citekey":"kowalik2025"},{"id":"holtgrewe2024l","type":"report","event-place":"Leuven","language":"en","publisher":"HIVA","publisher-place":"Leuven","source":"Zotero","title":"How stakeholder engagement can work - methodological report on approaches used to engage stakeholders in the UNTANGLED project.
