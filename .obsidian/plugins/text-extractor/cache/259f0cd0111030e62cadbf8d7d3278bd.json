Here, we can see clearly the limits of the traditional ontology. No “subject” or “individual” (or “group” of subjects and individuals) could ever be this origin. Not only is the amount of ecological, sociological, psychoanalyt- ical, etc., knowledge, both theoretical and applied, necessary to engineer the organization of a primitive tribe, for instance, of such a complexity that it defies imagination and is, at any rate, far beyond our grasp; but, more radically, “subjects, ” “individuals,” and their “groups” are themselves the products of a socialization process, for their existence presupposes the existence of an instituted society. Neither can we find this origin in “chings”; the idea that myths or music are the (however roundabout) outcome of the operation of the laws of physics is just meaningless. Nor, finally, can we reduce the various institutions of the known societies and their corresponding significations to “concepts” or “ideas” {Hegel}. We have to recognize that the social-historical field is irreducible to the traditional types of being, that we observe here the works, the creation of whar I call the social imaginary, or the instituting society (as opposed to the instituted society)—being careful not to make of it another “thing,” another “subject,” or another “idea.”","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"deu+eng+tur"}
